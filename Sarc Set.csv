1,Never too young to start the Atkins diet!,"My sister likes to mention her ""research"" to me when I question some of her decisions about her child's health, whether its vaccinations, cleaning products (she now makes her own shampoo &amp; conditioner because too many chemicals in store bought ones) and her newest one, fruit. She claims that fruit has too much sugar in it, which is unhealthy for her baby."

1,Glad to see you haven't self-diagnosed yourself with depression!,"I really try not to blame things on it, because I could have so many worse disorders. But it really makes life tough. It's a good thing I'm not depressive, or I'd really hate myself."

1,Because women have to be the center of attention.....?,"Why is American wedding culture so sexist? Wall of text ahead, so I apologize in advance. It's summer now so wedding season is in full swing. I had to attended two weddings this weekend so maybe it's just the fact that I got double the normal exposure at once, but why is the whole attitude around American weddings so sexist? The two weddings I attended couldn't have been more different. Wedding one was pretty much your stereotypical Midwestern wedding. Church ceremony, limo ride to the reception hall, big dinner, and a dance. I can't even count the number of times I heard that it was the bride's special day, and that we need to make sure she's happy. I was a groomsman in this wedding and when I asked the groom why we had to wear bow ties he told me because the bride said so. It felt like the groom had very little say in things. Even at the reception when people were giving speeches there were constant jokes at the groom's expense. If you didn't know people were joking you'd think he was entering a life of indentured servitude from the way they were talking. Wedding number two was much different in it's presentation, but there were similar undertones. It was a much smaller wedding. It felt more personal and you could tell that the groom did get to have some say in how things were done. However people still made the same jokes and comments about how his life was over and the wife was the boss. Maybe I'm just being over sensitive but by the end of the weekend this all really got to me. Years ago when my wife and I were working on stuff for our wedding she made a comment about ""her wedding"". I responded with, ""You mean our wedding?"". It took her a second but she corrected herself and I never heard her refer to it as ""her wedding"" again. It may have been a small thing, but it was important to me that we both understood that we were equal partners in this. I felt like I got an equal say in all the aspects that were important to me and there weren't any jokes at my expense in anyone's speeches. I couldn't have been happier with how it turned out. So why is the culture around weddings like this? It baffles me my more men don't stand up for themselves and ask to be treated as equals. After all this day is supposed to be about the couple, not just the bride."

1,The UNSC has made a Spartan sports league to generate money.,"IMO The most important thing about the Halo 5 reveal: ""Arena"" I think it's safe to assume that the use of the word ""Arena"" is not accidental and would indeed represent a paradigm shift in the gameplay back to traditional arena styled Halo combat. Hands down this is the most important thing for me that I can take away from the Halo 5 debut. What do you guys thing about the return to Arena styled combat after halo reach and Halo 5 were more geared towards larger scale ground combat?"
1,"Yeah, I wish they kept it so that you had to spend 100s of hours just get a set piece like in D3V.","I don't believe it for now. The decrease in the rarity of set items is plain stupid for example. Seriously, it's already easy enough to get the gear. Soon, you'll be able to get a fully geared character in 1 day if that patch is real."
