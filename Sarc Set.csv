1,Because women have to be the center of attention.....?,"Why is American wedding culture so sexist? Wall of text ahead, so I apologize in advance. It's summer now so wedding season is in full swing. I had to attended two weddings this weekend so maybe it's just the fact that I got double the normal exposure at once, but why is the whole attitude around American weddings so sexist? The two weddings I attended couldn't have been more different. Wedding one was pretty much your stereotypical Midwestern wedding. Church ceremony, limo ride to the reception hall, big dinner, and a dance. I can't even count the number of times I heard that it was the bride's special day, and that we need to make sure she's happy. I was a groomsman in this wedding and when I asked the groom why we had to wear bow ties he told me because the bride said so. It felt like the groom had very little say in things. Even at the reception when people were giving speeches there were constant jokes at the groom's expense. If you didn't know people were joking you'd think he was entering a life of indentured servitude from the way they were talking. Wedding number two was much different in it's presentation, but there were similar undertones. It was a much smaller wedding. It felt more personal and you could tell that the groom did get to have some say in how things were done. However people still made the same jokes and comments about how his life was over and the wife was the boss. Maybe I'm just being over sensitive but by the end of the weekend this all really got to me. Years ago when my wife and I were working on stuff for our wedding she made a comment about ""her wedding"". I responded with, ""You mean our wedding?"". It took her a second but she corrected herself and I never heard her refer to it as ""her wedding"" again. It may have been a small thing, but it was important to me that we both understood that we were equal partners in this. I felt like I got an equal say in all the aspects that were important to me and there weren't any jokes at my expense in anyone's speeches. I couldn't have been happier with how it turned out. So why is the culture around weddings like this? It baffles me my more men don't stand up for themselves and ask to be treated as equals. After all this day is supposed to be about the couple, not just the bride."

But it has to be with someone who has an informed opinion.

If a cop cornered a female driver and proceeded to do the same thing, it would be sexual harassment. If a teacher cornered a female student and used his power over her to discuss her reproduction potential, it would be sexual harassment. So, I ask, how is this not sexual harassment?

What are my options for a similar type battery that will work with the EVOD as well as other common ones like protank, aerotank, etc. I'm looking at the Vision spinner II. Any ideas about the quality of that thing and should I watch out for knockoffs? Also, is it worth going to a dual coil atty for more clouds?

I realized that for lots of people, they haven't had the experiences to build up that ""reverse engineering"", and for them, decent colorization helps to make these images go from strange and unfamiliar to much more direct, real and understandable. So, I'll skip the rant. A lot of these are ""snapshots"" so it's not like destroying a great work of art (eg colorizing great B&amp;W images from the likes of Ansel Adams or Henri Cartier-Bresson) (that said, in quite a few of the images I find the colorizing a bit clumsy and distracting... oh well.)"
1,blah blah blah cause elitist,Exactly. It's not a skill. It's knowledge about the game which give you an advantage for no apparent reason.

What if the other guy plays as well and loses only because he doesn't know the timer? Why should that knowledge and the capability to properly time it give you such an huge advantage?

1,"oh wow, an EA game being rushed and buggy, i did now expected that","EA UFC - Just some dirty facts You can't get a leg kick tko, you can only temporarily make an opponent move slower. So combined with the healing above, they are next to pointless. Straight punches can only be done when stationary, so no darting around on the outside of hooks throwing straights. There are no natural counters; you can't step out of range and counter after an opponent misses, or when they are open at the beginning of an attack. The only way the game will register a hit as a counter is after parrying or dodging with the dodge move. Intercepting opponent has no affect on their accuracy of attacks (so can't for instance jab someone in the face and make their hook miss like in fight night). It's both too fast and too slow. The fighters seem to have infinite stamina and fight at 100 mph, but input lag means that attacks are queued like Fight Night Champion, which you can't break out of. You can't block quick enough after throwing an attack, and attacks don't interupt an opponent's attack, so you end up with just a sloppy brawl. Parry is also held down rather than being a twitch reaction, and only up or down, so no mixing up of directions throwing 2 left hooks instead of left right for instance. No feinting. No stopping an attack after it has been launched. It takes almost no stamina to do special moves, so you can spam the most riddiculous, jumping, reverse, spinning, tornado, cartwheel, backflip, butterfly, wheel, bicycle, helicopter kicks with no penalty whatsoever like a spasticated Eddie Gordo at all times. Most of these are unpunishable and can't be interrupted, not even by leg or push kick. You can't take someone down when they have their back turned or are doing a crazy kick, so no countering reverse moves with shooting. You can do reverse moves standing right next to an opponent (such as a spinning back kick, which would require space in real life, else you wouldn't have room to get your foot there. Wouldn't do anything at all and you'd probably fall over). However, said moves (all moves) do verrry little damage. You can eat reverse turning kicks for breakfast. Special attacks, particularly kicks, should do way more damage, take way more stamina to do and be way more dangerous to attempt. Sidestepping sometimes changes stance for no reason. There is no sprawl. Takedowns are difficult to defend against: once an opponent has touched you, there's nothing you can do about it. Slams have a smaller window of time in which to defend against them than normal takedowns. Can do a slam, transition or tornado kick at 0 stamina. No ability to flatten out backmount. Can't catch kicks. Can't damage oponent by checking kicks. You fall over if you kick someone on the ground. Can't move someone around the cage on the ground. Transition from half guard top has no animation difference between going left and right, so choosing which direction to defend is a total gamble. Ref stands you up in no time at all from the ground: you can be in side mount, even FULL mount and if there's not much going on for about 8 seconds then you'll get stood up. However, you can wall and stall for infinity. The most basic, simple to do transition from guard puts you into FULL MOUNT! From full mount, postured up, using hooks, undefended... it takes about 20+ clean hits to knock someone out. Totally lacking in oomph, character seems to possess strange pillow fists. You can't touch gloves at all, or taunt of your own accord. If you hold halfway through a transition on the ground, the opponent can't hit you (so you can repeat indefiniately until the ref stands you up). Both top and bottom lose stamina no matter what happens on the ground, so can just keep spamming transitions. If you get clinched, you can attempt a takedown and if successful take to floor, if fail get pushed out of clinch. So basically, you can't be kept in clinch. No standing submissions. I was wrong in a previous post about rubber guard/crucafix positions not being in the game, you have to hold a special modifier to transition to those positions. However, when the more basic transition in those positions moves you straight into full mount, then what would be the point? No moving head when on the floor in guard to dodge bombs, no grabbing wrists to stifle attack (could be a minor transition and set-up to armbar). No standing subs."

We've had almost zero contact since she moved out 6 weeks ago, and I have been slowly moving toward recovery. However, we started talking again yesterday, and I realized that I am still very attached. Our relationship was super solid for three years, but things got a lot harder after my son from a previous relationship moved in last year. We broke things off when she told me she wasn't interested in marriage in the foreseeable future and felt like she was wasting my time. Within days, she had moved out of the apartment and we initiated a ""no contact"" rule to make it a clean break. Over the past six weeks, we have spoken only briefly to coordinate splitting shared possessions. In that time, I have made a lot of progress toward healing from the break-up. I've been working out, working on me, and trying to be social to make new friends (because we work together and many of our friends were shared). Yesterday, she reached out to ask if we could try being friends. I agreed, but after meeting her for lunch, I realized that I still have very strong feelings for her. Late last night, I emailed her to tell her that I wasn't going to risk my new-found personal growth by ""settling"" for something less than friends. I told her that I either wanted her as my partner and lover, or that we should cut off contact again for the foreseeable future. I expected her to respond that she didn't want anything more than friends, or even just to go back to not talking anymore. Instead, she said she wanted to explore things as a couple again, and we are now going out on a date this weekend. I feel like I stood up for my needs, but I worry that I'm just setting myself up for more pain. At this point, I can't accept a relationship where she is also dating other people (I don't know if she is). On the other hand, we live apart now, and I am dedicated to maintaining a stable, happy home for my son. That situation doesn't leave a lot of time for us to rebuild what we had before, and I worry that this will be fruitless and painful. I am very interested in your thoughts and opinions on this. Thanks! --- **tl;dr**: I'm taking my ex-girlfriend out on a date this weekend after 6 weeks of ""no contact"", but I worry I'm just setting myself up for more pain and a longer recovery."

Say what you will about playing alone, but I'm sure there are hundreds, if not thousands of players like me. Another strategy of mine is to sneak way behind enemy lines. Problems with this: * Very few infantry terminals anymore. * Again, no way of telling lots of friendlies about a huge enemy presence, etc. Lettuce: * During an alert, now there's a handful of large fights. Pre-lettuce there could be a few large fights and a dozen small fights. 1v1s, 2v2s, etc. These smaller fights made me personally feel like I was contributing, as many times I could use personal skill and tactics to capture a small outpost with just a few defenders. The lettuce and screwy limited spawn points means more defenders will show up. 10v1 isn't good odds. * Having fewer bases to fight over means the screwy resource system can screw me over. If I want aero resources, I might be limited to fighting in one or two hexes, or none even."

1,"But of course speed has nothing to do with this, if the lambo had been traveling under the speed of light the mazda should have seen him coming.","Not entirely true. The right of way gives you the presumptive at-fault element, but you can also be contributorily negligent in causing the accident. One example of contributory negligence is speeding. (If you think of the accident as being 100% of a problem, then you speeding adds to that problem, and some of the blame is shifted on you. This is what happens in cases where people don't wear their seat-belts and are injured in a car accident, where wearing the seat-belt would have prevented a majority of the injuriues, and the jurisdiction's laws dictate that one must wear a seat-belt.) In this case, if the Lambo was speeding, the driver of the Mazda will probably be held for a majority at fault, but the Lambo's speeding needs to be factored in to the equation. The exact percentage will be determined by the courts and the quality of the lawyers hired by the insurance agency. If the Lambo was not speeding, and obeyed all traffic laws before the crash, then yes, the driver of the Mazda will most likely be 100% at fault."

I used to be able to see what level I was and if the Mod was one level higher than my current level I knew I was good. Now a Mod rating of 109 or 140 or whatever tells me nothing.

I personally have never held or fired a gun but I don't have a problem with law abiding citizens owning them. The process definitely needs to be changed tho, ie firearms license similar to drivers license. The people who say they want their guns to protect themselves against the government are just silly tho. The government has drones. However, I do think people should have a right to protect themselves too against home invaders / random violence and I don't want to live in a police state, although we pretty much do. I don't want to have to rely on the government for EVERYTHING."

With limited supplies and on constant search for food and safety from zombies and other players, I'm pretty certain that most of the talking will be done with a raised gun or with guns themselves, I don't expect a whole lot of in game role playing conversations to be taking place. Talking to much will get you killed out in the open and I doubt we will be seeing player created towns were you can sit down without worrying about getting shot in the back."

That department then takes over the responsibility of maintaining that vehicle until the point that something happens that causes the military to need it again. So instead of the army spending millions maintaining a fleet of trucks it's not using atm in case of future need, it's put to use by police departments until there is a need for it. My city has one that is basically used for publicity. They bring it out to fairs and events. During holidays they park it near busy commuter routes with the hope that it will remind people to drive safer."

1,Well this isn't completely subjective.,"Dota 2 is completely free but significantly harder. It follows the TF2 formula of free to play. Only thing you buy is character skins. Runs on Source and made by Valve, so the graphics are much better then LoL. All the heroes are balanced really well due to the sadistic genius that is icefrog, and the pro games are much more interesting and fun to watch as a result. I prefer Dota 2. League is not as free (you have to buy or grind for 3 years to play all the champions). It is much easier but very poorly balanced. A pool of about 15-20 champions ever see competitive play. Graphics are celshaded and colorful but significantly dated. I see zero reason to play LoL over Dota, but I still do regularly because my friends are awful at Dota and think the can go pro at League, which won't happen because they suck at league too. Overall I'd recommend Dota 2. League is not worth the grind/price of entry. Dota is free and better. Only negative is how hard it is. Anyone who says otherwise is in denial. Come at me fanboys."

1,There's always seventh day adventism lol,"Church just doesn't work for me Hey all, Just kinda want to vent and ask for advice. So I am a young adult who is trying to root myself in a local church close to home, and the search isn't going so well. One of my biggest obstacles is my job. I work in retail which involves a sporadic schedule that involves working numerous Sundays, and I can never tell exactly which ones because the schedule is always random. On my Sundays off, I have tried different churches. Pastors, deacons, and members greet me, and want to get to know me, but it's hard to explain to every single one of them my situation, and it can easily be over a month before I can make it back to that church again. By that time, everyone has forgotten me, and I have to start all over again. Or the people that do pay attention wonder what the heck is wrong with me when they notice my random attendance. Another frustrating thing is I will use a Sunday off to visit a church, and what do ya know? It's a unique Sunday service where a guest preacher comes in and gives a presentation/report on his mission trip and thanks the church for their support, and I get no chance to hear from the church's senior pastor. Then I work five straight Sundays, and it's not even worth going back to try it again. All this has left me disillusioned, and just kept me out of church altogether. Church just doesn't work for somebody like me. I want to be a part of a local body really bad, and have a place for my faith home, but it just doesn't work. Any advice out there? A lot of us here are of the same demographic that could be in a similar situation so I figured it might be good for other people here to check out."

Some still tip for doing that stuff though, which is nice; and not all of my customers have me build it for them anyway."

1,Racism doesn't exist anymore.,"Really, usually the racism is at least a little veiled. But here it's literally ""All black people are Hitler, why the fuck did they even let them in?""

1,They're called breast plates for a reason,"Can I just point out: Female armour. Visuals-wise, there's a bit of boob-plate going on, sure, but other than that, the armour is as modest as the male's versions. I know that's hardly surprising for a TES game, but for an MMO, it's pretty rare. So hell yeah to Zenimax for that one. It is refreshing to have the option of heavily armour female or heavily armoured male, instead of heavily armoured male and strong bikini woman."

It's all about making money and companies love to use the ""loyalty"" card to trick employees into staying for low pay. There is a reason why companies love ""at will"" contracts because it puts all the power in their lap. They are well aware how desperate people are to keep their jobs or get one. If you want to be paid well you have to be in a field that allows mobility and competition for talented individuals. Its the reason a lot of people in tech get paid well.

1,bro,"First of all, ""handsome"" is an adjective---not a fucking noun. Nouns are words for things and since you can't have a handsome in your pants, it's not a noun. Second of all, the comparative form of two-syllable adjectives which don't end on the letter ""y"", is (normally) formed with ""more"". So, ""more handsome"" would be OK. Of course, there are a few two-syllable adjectives that occasionally break the rule: you sometimes hear people say ""quieter"" or ""cleverer"" or ""gentler"" or, yes, even ""handsomer"" so they're ok, too."
1,Now I can get great speeds like my uni offers!,"Maybe, just maybe, we should deem the internet an essential public service,and take it out of private hands.

My personal philosophy dictates that everyone should have the option of suicide, even prisoners, at any point in their life that they feel it appropriate.

It should be a legal option that people can take so they stop messing up other people's days by jumping off bridges or in front of trains because there are no cleaner routes available to them."

1,"TIL racism and xenophobia never, ever, existed or happened before the evil whiteman invented it and took it everywhere....","The mod's reaction was a knee-jerk one (they probably deal with a lot of ignorance) and a ban definitely seems disproportionate. I totally agree with you on the anti-circlejerk thing, but here's something to consider. When you define racism in a post-colonial context, the oppression to be dismantled is an institutional one. It doesn't make sense to say that because Zimmerman wasn't white that Western ideas of race didn't play a part in the death of Trayvon Martin. If we take that logic to look at the ""black"" and ""brown"" supremacy you talk about, a genealogy of power will show that all of the modern racial violence (Rwanda, Darfur, East Timor, etc.) can be traced back to colonialism. If minorities kill each other over bread, it's just violence. But when conflict breaks out along racial lines, it can't be properly discussed without realizing that race is only relevant because white people used it to justify centuries of oppressive economic systems in every continent. Except Antarctica. Everyone's white in Antarctica. Nearly every racial supremacy you can think of is a reaction to the way white people enforced it. I don't mind talking about it, but I certainly understand how some people can get tired of continuously giving history lessons. I hope we can generate some productive discourse instead of leaving you feeling bitter. Again, feel free to talk to me! tl;dr Race is only a big deal because white people made it a big deal when they robbed other civilizations."

Do you remember how you felt when someone posted a link to a site that was filled with attacks on the pope and Catholic teachings? Remember how you felt when you read that the pope is the Antichrist and Catholics are hellbound followers of a false gospel? This guy seems to have a major thing about Martin Luther and Lutherans. Do we have theological differences with Lutherans? Yes, of course. However, the way to go about discussing these differences is *not* to start with ""Martin Luther was a horrible heretic and Lutheran ecclesiology is soooo stupid!"""

He's just uneducated about certain key facts that tar his whole reasoning process so that when he carries his conclusions to completion he sounds like a megalomaniac. I get the impression that he's an extremely smart kid in an extremely average high school, which structures the way he views society. This is because he states things he thinks his audience is too dense to get by implication so he feels the need to say it explicitly (""the universe is far too complicated for it to be absolutely necessary to kill anyone""), and you tend to do this less as you get used to speaking in front of more educated audiences, which by consequence also makes you sound more sincere while expressing higher-level ideas. He also seems to think things about government (""nobody's even checking if they might be better than what we have now"") that would only be true if you took your experiences (genius ubermensch among bunch of idiots) and projected it on the world at large. With this said, he writes and thinks at a very high level and assuming he doesn't have anything pathologically wrong with him (which I doubt he does, this isn't the first time the world has seen a hubristic teenager) he will probably grow into a really interesting thinker once he hits college / graduate school."

I'm a vegan and I love animals, so I thought I'd give asking here a shot! :) As far as I understand it, people call up PETA to take stray dogs somewhere safe, instead of them being out on the streets, then PETA keeps them somewhere for a while, with food, water and shelter, and if they're healthy have them be available for adoption. As they don't have infinite resources or money, they put the dogs down if no one adopts them. This is a very sad thing and it hurts me to think this happens to ANY animal... But I don't see an alternative. They can't just kick the dog out, and they couldn't possibly keep every single stray dog in their facilities till they die of natural causes. It seems like the people to blame here are the people who tie their dogs to a post and leave them, instead of the PETA. But as I said, I'm not very educated on this and I'm open to anyone who knows more than me :) Thank you!"

Now I don't mind them, I just find them boring. ""Oh boy, you put even more hops in this one than the other brewer, amazing."" That said I *will* go for a good IPA if I know it's gonna be super fresh, e.g. a Stone Enjoy-By on draft right after it releases. A super fresh IPA is still a nice experience in my book. Also, it's frustrating when you're at a bar or a liquor store and the overwhelming majority of their beer choices are just a million different types of IPA, and maybe a token wheat beer."

I will be taking roughly 4g today and wanted to know if I should buy weed beforehand. TBH, I am just worried I won't feel much or trip out w/o weed.

There was a bowling alley that had a pretty nice pool hall/arcade/bar, where I would go with my friends. A friend and I are playing Mortal Kombat II, and I notice out of the corner of my eye a kid around 4 or 5 watching us play. A few minutes later, a woman comes up to us and asks ""Where is the little boy that was watching you play?"". We reply that we don't know. She huffs and says ""Thanks a lot!"", and storms off to find her son. Apparently, I, as a longhaired teenager in a bar playing a video game, was supposed to babysitting this unknown child."

1,It's cool Holtby and Emery are friends,"So if Chara comes skating after Nathan Gerbe and starts dropping haymakers on him, Gerbe should try and fail to stop him to prove his ""toughness"".. that's some pretty stupid logic. There are plenty of other ways to be tough while playing hockey. Hockey is a game where fighting is allowed (in some leagues) if two players consent to it it. It's not a fighting sport. Once you exceed the consent rule you are on the hook for civil and criminal liability. I'm still amazed from last year when that dumbass ref St. Laurent allowed Emery to assault Holtby despite Holtby's clear protest. If Holtby had been injured, particularly a concussion, the league would have been scrambling to cover their asses."

1,Yeah when Galadriel was going apeshit on Sauron.,"Did anyone who saw The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies experience ASMR at a certain scene? (POSSIBLE SPOILERS FOR THE LATEST HOBBIT MOVIE WITHIN) I was just curious if anyone else was triggered when Gandalf and Bilbo were sitting on top of the icy ridge next to the Lonely Mountain and Gandalf was cleaning his pipe. I was definitely triggered, even though I didn't feel full fledged tingles (due to the fact that I'm almost immune at the moment) and wanted to know if anyone else felt them too. Also, do you guys think it's easier to get triggered when it isn't the usual time or taking place in the usual environment in which you regularly watch videos (e.g. I watch a video before I go to sleep every night and don't usually get tingles from tapping noises, but the 20-30 seconds in which Gandalf was scraping and tapping his pipe were enough to trigger me while in the theater)? I remember seeing this asked before but it didn't have any answers at the time I saw it, and had hung in the back if my mind ever since."

1,"Indeed, in my experience I've found that women who are ""victims"" of domestic abuse actually did something to deserve it.","There are a few main reasons why there are situations where it's acceptable to hit a man but not a woman. 1. If one were to keep score, one would find that women, as a gender, suffer more than - and often because of - men. Just like how African-Americans are considered a historically disadvantaged group (because of things like slavery, Jim Crow, and racism in general), women can be considered a historically disadvantaged gender. As a result, a woman hitting a man is like a black person calling a white person ""cracker"", and complaining about woman-on-man violence is like complaining about black-on-white racism: sure, they happen, but not nearly as often as man-on-woman violence or white-on-black racism. 2. Men are generally bigger and bulkier than women and can, therefore, take more physical punishment. A woman punching a man hardly does any damage to the man most of the time. A man punching a woman does quite a bit of damage. 3. In my experience, I've typically found that men who are ""victims"" of domestic violence or abuse actually did something to deserve it."

It's not just that they're selling outside, it's that the police *constantly* stop and search them. If I had been pulled over or stopped by the police on a daily or near-daily basis as a kid, they would have likely found drugs on me, and once or twice found enough to charge me with distribution. The court system also assumes criminal intent of these kids in a way it doesn't for white kids (children who are beaten up or stabbed are often charged for fighting and being part of a gang [assumption being there must have been a reason they were attacked]) and then, once arrested, are watched by the entire community as future criminals. It becomes nearly impossible to do anything without racking up arrests (once you're charged with a crime as an accessory to a gang, hanging out with your friends, or walking through the wrong neighborhood becomes an arrestable offense). It's not a fucking accident that blacks are more likely to be stopped, arrested, charged, convicted, serve harsher sentences, and generally get fucked over every step of the way by our criminal justice system than their white counterparts. It's part of the system itself."

However as I progressed, I felt like it was time to start a new character, I chose a hunter and I am currently level 14 and am using the bladedancer subclass. However I have had success, I feel like I am playing the class wrong. I am unsure as to what weapons should be used, what kind of skills I need to take, and overall the mentality of playing a bladedancer. It just doesn't seem worth it at the moment, having progressed in the same so much on my warlock, I find myself constantly in conflict as to what I want to play. I would really appreciate some tips, builds and anything that may help me succeed. Sorry if this post seems all over the place. Please feel free to comment Thanks again redditors."

I stared at it for a couple seconds, gingerly took it by the corner and laid it on the counter. there aren't many things that gross me out but that was wayyyyy on the top of my list. I had purchased hand sanitizer for us lowly clerks to use (the owner was too cheap to supply it) but that was FAR from sufficient. as far from sufficient as one can get. I didn't even wait for the next customer, I asked, nay, TOLD the assistant manager to jump in my spot while I went in the bathroom and used scalding hot water, soap and probably floor stripper to sanitize myself. I left that money sitting on the counter until it dried, picked it up with rubber gloves, put it in a deposit envelope and at the end of the night that $20 stayed right in that envelope and got added to the deposit.

From the knowledge I do have though, doesn't it just stimulate a nerve in your middle ear to affect your balance? Wouldn't that just make you fall out of your fucking chair and smash your face?

It's definitely a circlejerk, and it's definitely ""in"" to like murakami, but to dismiss him because of that is hella misguided, and to say that he doesn't write literature is fucking stupid as hell. There's whatever vague line between ""fiction"" and ""literature"" you want to draw, but Murakami is way on one side of that line.

There's nothing unreasonable with mandating that signage should be presented in an official, legally recognized language of the majority of people living in a geographic area. The problem is everything else. French must be twice the scale of any other language, when there's no direct translation of a word or term you simply can't use the word or term, municipal road way and safety signage is displayed in French only, etc...

1,"Hey man, spending nearly an entire episode talking about buying a house is super entertaining.","And the thing that really pisses me off about patreon (I'm not a donor, but I do have common sense) is that they get $8,000 (roughly) EVERY month and the show has not improved in any way, whether it'd be bigger guests, longer shows, better quality, adding actual structure to the show. Woody claims he's so ambitious and is always striving to make the show better, I see 0 effort, the only one who's still keeping the show alive is honestly Kyle, he tries every week to come up with something interesting to do on the show (Jeremy Hweel of Pain, the potato cannon etc..) and not to offend anyone, he's the only one bringing entertainment and lolz to the show... It just feels like they're leeching money that they don't need financially and work-wise because as far as I'm concerned the show is still at it's amateur form, the way it's been since EP 1."

1,"There were other guys who were equally (or more) insane, all created and supported by a system that awarded such behavior, so his level of madness is acceptable.","I've read a fair bit of criticism on Scott, and I don't think 'maniac' is anywhere near appropriate. He had tons of flaws, no doubt, but many of those flaws could be found in most of the leaders of most British era of arctic/antarctic exploration. John Ross invented entire mountain ranges in order to flee the arctic after just one season, Franklin lost his entire expedition in part because he and his officers refused to hunt, finding it below them since the Innuit hunted, so they were susceptible to scurvey and lead poisoning from poorly tinned food. McClure trapped his men for four winters because he refused to back down from insanely dangerous conditions simply because he wanted the passage so badly, very nearly could have lost another 150 men just like Franklin, but miraculously saved by Belcher... Most of those guys had serious flaws, I see Scott as merely a continuation of that line. I don't think any of them (save for McClure, perhaps) were truly inept, it was just the nature of the Royal Navy to adhere so strongly to rank and rigid structure that their expeditions were never flexible enough for the arctic/antarctic."

For Dr. Strange you'll wanna look up the series Strange Tales for his origin and most of his comics. I don't think he's had any solo series recently but please someone correct me if I'm wrong. I believe both the 2006 and 2010 runs of Heroes for Hire are on MU as well. The 1998 run of Daredevil is one of my favorites and is on MU in its entirety. The first 6 issues were written by Kevin Smith and are really well done."

We play games together a lot and honestly? I couldn't help but like him. We get along, he tells me how he can't wait for us to move back to Ottawa so we can all hang out, ect. It just seems like I'm dating the wrong guy? I don't know I'm going to give it a week to think over and see how I feel. My question is, has any one else fallen for the best friend? How did it go?

I know that most of you were expecting a comeback from an old producer, but it's not cool to hate on Stonebank because this. He worked hard on this song, probably had to wait a while so the rooster could have some variation, made the track FOR FREE, and this is the feedback he recieve. I don't expect you all to enjoy the song, since some people don't like his style and that's reasonable. But some people just did some bad things, like disliking the song just because Stonebank, and even say that it was the worse MCat anniversary ever just because it wasn't a comeback. This is not only offensive to the producer but also offensive for the label. I know you hyped for another producer, but there's nothing we can do about it. Thank you for your time."

If Embiid doesn't have that injury (or at least the teams don't hear about it) until after the draft, Embiid would have probably went first, Cleveland would have to wait a year to get him and I would imagine that might've kept Lebron from going back. I honestly believe the next move is going to be Wiggins to somewhere for a stud to complete a big 3 of Irving, Lebron, ______. If I was betting I would bet on it being Love. With Wiggins that's possible. With Embiid, I'm not so sure. That draft and the events leading up to it really set the table for this move in more ways than one, IMO."
1,Radiating positivity is going to Kanye just to boo the whole time.,"What does it mean to radiate positivity? This year was my first Bonnaroo and it was an amazing experience. I went for the music and was in no way disappointed with seeing some of my favorite bands (Neutral Milk Hotel was almost worth the price of the ticket alone). That being said, the main thing I took away from the whole trip was the way that the community controlled itself through ""positivity."" Everyone was made to feel comfortable in their own skin. I was encouraged at every step of the way and in every action I took. Everyone seemed to feed off of each other and reinforce this positivity. Everyone was allowed to do their thing. But this freedom didn't seem to lead to any negative behavior or major conflicts. In fact, it seemed like positivity achieved two things: everyone was allowed to do their own thing and everyone remained courteous to the larger community. I mentioned to my friend that I was thirsty at one point, and three strangers heard me and offered me some water. It was both individualism and collectivism taken to the extreme. As a political science major, I am in awe at the way the community regulated itself through positivity. But what exactly is ""positivity""? How does it work? Any thoughts? TL;DR: Tell me about your experiences with positivity! I want to learn!"

We had a rich history of martial arts, akhaara culture but still, now a days, on an average an Indian male seems weak and seldom interested in exercising or physical training. Why is it so? Is it because of malnutrition, genetics or because from a young age we are taught to pay more attention to studies rather than physical activities? Just wanted to know what others think. My opinion on the matter is, there are certain attributes like height that is determined by your genes. Building up physical strength depends on your determination and hard work.

1,because if you try to win you're a sweaty Dorito fingered nerd,"I really believe this article brings up a lot of different points that summarizes many of the underlying reasons as to why there is such a rift between casual players and the competitive community. As my personal hypothesis, a large staple of casual gaming belief is that a game is meant to be played how it is out of the box, and that tampering with the settings removes the ""fun"" aspects from the game. However, what confuses me to no end, is how the consistent casual Halo player cannot wish to grasp onto a balanced competitive atmosphere, considering the majority of their online gameplay is traditionally in team based gametypes wherein you are trying to defeat another team. That core concept in and of itself screams that every Halo fan should look to play on an even playing field that offers the ability to improve as a player. Yet often times when we, the competitive community, offer solutions to this problem, we are met with disinterest and sometimes backlash. It's all very confusing to me as to why this continues to be the case, but I agree with your points on why H5 can be a different case. Diminishing the leap that a casual gamer has to make to be a part of the competitive community can only make it easier for Halo 5 as an eSports title to take root and solidify its place for years to come. Casual gamers playing the same game as competitive gamers only bridges the community, as the one goal that both sets of communities strive for will be the same, therefor more common ground is established, populations increase and help each other thrive, and its just all around easier for all forms of gamers to be able to connect with one another. There are some key points that could be argued against a competitively influenced design direction, but if thoroughly tested and proven to be successful, there really doesn't seem to be much of a reason NOT to take this route over others. At the end of the day, building the game competitively is going to give it longevity while still offering a very entertaining experience for casual gamers looking for quick fast and fun games and a rewarding experience for competitive gamers wanting to improve and become the best they can be."

I was replying to is confusing net neutrality with what Netflix is doing, and conflating service cost issues as well. Comcast going from 105mbit for $100 a month to 105mbit for $50 a month, or greater speeds when Google comes into town has nothing to do with peering congestion. Things will be just as congested, but other stuff will certainly be faster. The extra speed does help with congestion, too, because you can rebuffer more quickly once you start getting a good stream of data. Google's faster peering is mostly a result of fewer people using it. If you're on Comcast, do a traceroute to a big name site and see where your traffic goes. 2/3 of the hops between my current location and Google (over Comcast) are on Comcast's network. Based on it, its safe to assume every customer they have in NY, NJ, CT, and New England (and probably south) go through that same peering point in NYC. So Comcast has tens of millions of customers going through that peering point. Google rolls out fiber in a city, they may have, what? A few tens of thousands? They'd have the same peering congestion issues if they had tens of millions of people going through it, too. There's a lot of moving parts, and its not a simple topology of what is going on. Comcast is a horrid company that probably needs to be looked at by antitrust regulators, but its just being ignorant about how things work to say ""Google can do this, why can't Comcast?"" or ""Once Google comes into town, Comcast has no problems with this"". The comments show a lack of understanding of what is actually involved with providing service and the variables in that service."

Why are we so unappreciative about everything HiRez does for us? They created an awesome game and have provided endless hours of entertainment for us all, but yet we just spit back in their face. They work hard to provide us with a fun and free game, and we take that effort and stomp it out just because it wasn't perfect by our standards. Please, for the sake of HiRez, just stop being so mad at every little thing. They could just sit back and not update anything or add anything, so just be thankful for what we do have. TL;DR: They work hard, be greatful for what you get"

With several hours left in the day, would it be wise to sell off my shares to avoid a possible 5-10% drop that may come as a result of the vote? Is there any indication that net neutrality will be ensured and that NFLX might take a jump up? Thanks"

1,That dog must have had a great nose,"Clean out your cars regularly. So this just happened. Just to preface my story, i live in Kentucky where marijuana is the #1 cash crop here. And considering we grow a fuck ton of tobacco, that's saying something. So when I say weed flows through the state, I'm not joking at all. Anyway, so it's my last day of high school and of course my fucking school brings the k9 unit through the parking lot to go through all the students cars. They usually do this about once every 2-3 months so it usually happens about 3 or 4 times during the school year. Well, I've never had a problem with this as I don't smoke in my car or anything so there's never been a problem with the dogs alerting about my car. Today was different. I got called out of class and was taken to my car where there were about 5 police officers around it and a dog which had apparently ""alerted"" at my car. I was forced to open it and have it searched. About 20 minutes later and all of the fucking officers ripping my car apart, they found a nug about .1-.2 in size, it was so tiny. It was under my seat under the rug that stretches from under the seat to the front of the car under the pedals. There's no telling how long it'd been there because I haven't smoked or had bud in my car in over a month. I mean fuck, I could pass a drug test. My punishment? Charged with possession, can't attend any senior events, AND I CAN'T FUCKING WALK THE LINE AT GRADUATION. This is fucking outrageous. I mean the charge sucks, since I'm 18 it's not going to magically disappear off my record on my 18th birthday like usual. But FUCK. I just want to walk the god damn line, I've been looking forward to doing that since freshman year. So take a lesson and clean out your cars. Fuck me."

1,You make it sound like you are on the plane to enforce air travel regulations and not just to serve beverages and peanuts/pretzels.,"I would agree with you actually! Unfortunately U.S. regulations specifically prohibit their use for taxi, takeoff and landing, so the flight attendant cannot allow you use it. As to why they're not allowed I can't say. Air travel is really highly regulated, and getting things approved for use on the airplane is time-consuming and expensive (just look at how long it took them to finally lift the electronic device ban below 10,000 ft, for pete's sake!). My best guess is that the manufacturers of those devices mostly sell them as a general-purpose infant carrier, and have decided that any possible additional sales wouldn't be enough to offset the cost of getting them certified for use on the airplane. As opposed to car seat manufacturers, who are specifically selling them as safety restraint systems."

It seems like if you're talking to an active 'feminist' they are out there fighting just as hard for the causes of the LGBTQ community. There's just a ton of crossover. Which, in my mind, can only be explained by the fact that women have more empathy for the suffering of those groups because many of us have experienced actual discrimination and can relate to other oppressed groups.

If Pichu was ported in (maybe without the self damage, but a little weaker), he could be made into a duo character as The Pichu Bros. This works both because it would include Pichu as a unique and potentially useful character, and the Pichu Bros. are an actual thing!

The average human body has about 110,000 calories. So that means that he would have to devour 1950 people a day. To top it off, Due to the square cube law, The bones inside of him would become bigger faster than they get stronger. Therefore collapsing under themselves. Another point is that Being that big, his heart would have to be incredibly strong to pump blood through his body at a good rate. He would be okay in water. Thats why whales can be so large. But as soon as he stepped foot on land he would collapse under his own weight and hit the ground.

1,OH MY GOD JUST STOP TRYING TO SAVE ME MONEY,"It's not always about that. I worked for commission at a place as well. If I know more about a product and what you'll be using it for than you do (not difficult for 98% of people depending on the business you're in), then I can make intelligent recommendations. Also, it's sometimes helping some one overcome the mental programming everyone gets concerning sale people that isn't always worthwhile. Let me give you an example. You come in for a regular cell phone. I talk to you about some general uses and needs and end up telling you that I can give you this phone which we'll take care of for you if it should accidentally go out on you for the full 2 years of your contract, a new battery each year for the phone to make sure it holds the same charge for you the whole way through ($50x2), a car charger to go with the home charger for those times when you just forget to plug it in, and even a small headset to keep in the car so you can be safe if you have to drive and talk at the same time all for $75. Sounds like a pretty sweet deal right? Even if nothing goes wrong, you're getting about $100 worth of free batteries which more than covers the price of everything making it a real no brainer, and as a bonus you get the car charger right away and a head set which, especially in an emergency, could be very worthwhile to have. If I hadn't positioned it that way it would have gone something like this. ""Yep, this phone right here is actually free with a 2 year contract, but we also have this service plan that you can get with it for $50 that... oh... Oprah told you to never buy a service plan? Um... ok, but real quick this one is a bit different because it also covers... ok, gotchya. No service plan. Something that a lot of customers tend to miss if they don't snag it right away though is a car charger in case you forget to plug it in at night. You'll... you'll never forget. Ok, I understand. One last thing I really strongly recommend for safety purposes though, especially in an emergency is a headset. They're not very expensive and... well I understand that you might not use one day to day, but in case of an emergency like taking some one to the hospital for example it really does make the situation a whole lot more safe for... ah... ok. Just the phone then. Give me a minute while I ring that up."""

1,That's a very useful bot!,"list of reasons Russia invaded Ukraine I. warm water port I1. this port historically belonged to USSR (russia) I1. russia wants to maintain their hegemony. even though people might think that their political power ended with the fall of the soviet union, this is far from the truth. Russia maintains their influence over its former satellite states by leveraging a combination of ""soft"" and ""hard"" power. I1A. soft power - large population of ethnic ""russians"" in former soviet republics. I1B. hard power- Russia has great mineral wealth, and all the pipelines and railroad lines are old soviet structures, which go through former satellites, such as Ukraine. these pipelines supply western europe, and feed russia ever increasing amounts of wealth (price of oil jumped from 20 bucks a barrel to over 200 since 1999). Russian businessmen also own most of the energy distribution companies outside their borders (niggas makin' bank fuck yeah). II. trouble in Ukraine II1. besides russias geopolitical ambitions and ways of justifying their aggressive stance, is the burgeoning trouble in Ukraine. The protests in Ukraine functioned to exacerbate a divide in the population which existed since WW2. The divide being between Eastern and Western Ukraine, the east being historically majority Russian speaking, and the west being historically ukrainian/polish. the borders forged by stalin and hitler and the west, and whoever the fuck was involved in ww2, are not necessarily drawn along ethnic lines. the whole area was carved up willy nilly, and that goes against the ""nation state ideal"" which is kind of what our whole political-social-identity westphalian system is based on (every nation {group of people} gets their own state {nation}). II2. now leading out of that point, requires mentioning that the protests in Ukraine, which began as political protests against russias economic dominion of Ukraine, took a sharply nationalistic turn (think tea party retards, or adolf hitlers nazi party). The radical right wing protestors took over, and people WERE saying things like ""ukraine for ukrainians, get the russians out of here"". now that is a whole separate discussion about crowd theory and sociology, which i really am way too hungry to get into right now, someone feed me please for the love of god i hate college. anyways, basically, the protests were some fascist ass occupy wall street bullshit, with no direction, which spiraled so far out of control that they toppled the government. Now obviously this would make about half (40% is half, fuck you, its close enough, suck my college balls) of ukraines population very very nervous, because of YUGOSLAVIA!!! Ultra-right wing nationalist idiots caused a genocide and made the country fracture into 7 independent, shitty ass, poor as fuck, useless states based on ethnic divisions and nationalism... retarded... but good for slobodan milosevic who probably stood to make a pretty penny if all went his way... once again, seperate discussion but this is all connected, I promise. III. satellites be leavin', like ""fuck you putin"" III1. but putin be like ""fuck you niggas, you my bitches, suck these excessively large and steely putin-balls. i be putin my balls in your mouth. etc... basically, the balkans, kazakhstan, and Ukraine, all have people in them that want stronger ties with the european union. whether or not this will be good long term are debatable, one side citing the increased cost of goods that will plunge even more of the country into abject poverty with the adoption of the euro... and the other side which believes in a long term economic solution hinging on middlemanning russias mineral resources to western europe (albeit with long term goals including the adoption of policy that will lower gap between rich and poor, think americas trust buster shit). I may have confused something in the last few sentences, but im so hungry and this is keeping me from lunch so i will assume what i mean can be inferred...motherfucker? yeah whatever. this is basically like the first section about russias hegemony, but more specific about the exact economic problems posed by being europes poor ass 2nd world bitches, or russias poor ass second world bitches. Either way, eastern europe sucks balls, but as long as theres no genocides then russia is probably doing good. to end this all of a few notes that may give evidence of biases and whatever. 1. i am russian, from ukraine, east ukraine. 2. the divides in ukraine exist, this is why my family came to the US 20 years ago. economic and social and political reasons. ukraine is poor, the people are divided, always there is a hated group, whether its people of jewish ancestry (me) or people who speak russian in western ukraine (also me), or just general flag waving nationalism, which is always bad, no matter what. 3. putin wrote his PHD on russias mineral wealth... that's how he leverages political control. think dune ""he that controls the spice controls the universe"". the ""spice"" being oil. this basically means that he can do whatever he wants short of a massive full scale invasion of europe, which he is not going to do, russia is more than big enough... 4. slobodan milosevic is the ex-president of Croatia, the main nationalistic aggressor in what used to be the nation of Yugoslavia. 5. regarding the protests against corruption, all governments are corrupt, especially america. 6. protesting like in Ukraine, would never happen here, because if it did, the cops would KILL THE EVERLOVING FUCK OUT OF IT, and thats a good thing because people should be able to go do their shopping and shit without worrying about drunk populist assholes burning down the city. ok lunchtime, fuck this im dying."

1,That's some flawless logic right there.,"Why biotruths mean we should be a matriarchal society Women have a limited number of eggs they are born with, but men generate sperm until they die. This is scientific fact, and obviously all social interactions should be based on scientific fact because we as humans have binary genders and are dangerously close to extinction due to underpopulation. Now, if all women were supposed to do is reproduce, they would die after menopause. But they don't. Obviously they are meant for something beyond just reproduction. Men, however, a reproductive units for their whole life. I think this is a good argument for a matriarchal society, where women assume leadership roles once they reach menopause and transcend the purposes of silly breeders. After all, it is hormones that make people irrational, right? Men always have that aggressive alpha hormone testosterone coursing through their veins, but after menopause, women stop having hormones because of science and uteruses and stuff (we can call this hitting the second wall.) Therefore post-menopausal women are the ideal candidates for leading a society so that we can make lots and lots more babies."

It was one of the few times I have ever spoken up in that class. And I kinda lost my shit a little bit. They could not conceptualize that feminists aren't bra burning, men hating, radical females. It's literally just the belief than men and woman should be equal. My teacher took my side, and was helping me fight my case, but they refused to listen... Their stuberness to stay ignorant pissed me off so much. They mock sometimes for being a feminist now, but it doesn't bother me that much. I'm proud I believe in equality."

1,If you do the same math for nidalee you suddenly realise you need dfg,"Let's do some Math here, lets compare having a DFG with the Augement Death item and see which does more damage. * Without Augement death, Viktor's AP ratios are: .65, .70, and 2.47. That's a total of 3.82. * With Augement death, the AP ratios are: .65, .91, and 2.47. That's a total of 4.03. Seems like Augment death is the better option right? Let's actually input some AP. With Augment death, you have 99AP and +75 bonus base magic damage, with DFG you have 120AP. Let's assume you have 4 other AP items and runes to give you 450 AP. * 3.82*(120AP+450AP) = 2177 magic damage. * 4.03*(99AP+450AP) + 75 base burn damage = 2287 magic damage. Now let's take into consideration DFG's active which amplifies magic damage by 20%. Assume you used your active before your full combo: * 1.2*(2177 magic damage) + .2(1500 total base magic damage) = 2912 magic damage. DFG gives you 2912 magic damage while Augment death gives you 2177 magic damage (excluding shared base damage). And I'm not even considering the CDR that DFG gives, the percent health damage the active does, nor am I considering that Augment death concentrates all of its power into a single ability (which you can miss). TDLR; If you were to choose between DFG or Augment Death, DFG would give you 625 more magic damage, 10 percent CDR, and percent health damage on the active. Therefore DFG is more slot efficient than Augment death."

It was a slow afternoon when this guy came in, he looked about 16 and was an average build, maybe a little big. He was sweating a lot and it wasn't even very hot. He sits down at a table quietly and for like 6 straight minutes contemplates what he wants while counting his money, We have SEVENTEEN things on our menu, just point to what you want! It requires little thought! He finally gets his ass off the chair and he's still sweating! You have just been sitting down for 6 minutes?! Anyway. He comes up, asks for one of our meals, and asks for it large (why am I not surprised?) and a medium milkshake. He tries to make a little small chat and says the reason he is so sweaty is because he walked here (like a 15 minute walk?). Maybe if this loser stopped eating here he wouldn't be so damn sweaty walking for 15 minutes. His total comes out to $12.01 and he says he is a dollar short, so he asks to remove the milkshake and just get the meal with a regular drink. You idiot, you sat there for like six minutes contemplating what to buy with your money, are you so stupid you could not figure out your total would be $12.01? Anyway, after that his total is $9.50, surprisingly he pays with all one dollar bills and a 50 cent coin, but this isn't excusable for what hes put me through so far. though I CLEARLY SAW THREE MORE INDIVIDUAL DOLLARS IN HIS WALLET (he could have got the milkshake anyway, wtf?) He gets his food, thanks me (though he could have taken the time to actually make eye contact) and leaves. Gosh darn I don't like retail. Especially when I have to deal with people like this."

1,No trading FTW!,"Obtaining Required Items for Pet Build I was under the impression that getting Mask of Jeram wasn't too difficult as many of the post suggested people were getting this left and right by gambling their shards. I spent over 1,000 on helms and not once got it and instead ended up with just 1 legendary and it was some terrible helm that would spawn fetish upon killing multiple elites. Should I be gambling for other things first? I am under the impression this is very important for my build. I am currently going through T1 in groups and last night we did about 16-20 or so rift runs. In that time I got maybe 3 legendarys the entire time which was pathetic. I am not sure if I am just having the worst time with RNG but cannot understand how all of these other players are finding everything that they have. Of those 3 legendarys, only 1 was an upgrade which was the Jade set shoulders. The other 2 items was a Monk sword with Dex and nemesis gloves (can't complain about these bad boys). How often are you guys finding these WD items that all are discussing? I've even gone as far as tossing on additional magic find just begging for more legs to drop but am really having no luck. I am debating about going back to bounties as there might be one or two of those that could hold me over for now but was hoping to get some results in rifts as supposedly the drop rates were updated in my favor (yea right!). What are your suggestions for getting my hands on required items and please let me know if there are any sets I should focus on building too. Sincerely, The Doctor"

1,"The more armor the unit has, the higher the defense.","How exactly does Defense work? With the new units having leader skills such as ""Ignore units Defense"" and new items that do the same (Demon Lance), I feel like it's important to visit this topic as it doesn't seem to exist yet. Note: I'm not looking for speculation or guesses, more testing or research. An official answer from Gumi would be nice but that likely won't happen. So the easiest way to approach this is relative to Attack. It's pretty easy that each point in Attack increases your damage by 1. Simple. The first question would be how does defense reduce damage? Is it percentage based? Flat number based? Some sort of hybrid between the two? If I have one unit with 700 defense and one with 1400, and they both were attacked for a 1000 base damage attack, what would the resulting damage taken be? I remember seeing recently when fighting a Bat Mimic that my Lock with 1700 defense took ~450 damage and my Zeln with 750 defense took ~950 damage. So by going from 750 to 1700 defense it seems I almost reduced the damage by half. However, I don't think this is how it works. In another scenario I'd get hit by a weak AOE and half of my units would take 1 dmg per tick and one of my weaker units took 43 dmg per tick. I'm pretty sure the difference in defense didn't reduce the damage taken by 99%. Basically to ever take 1 damage means there is a flat number reduction somewhere in the calculation. One of the reasons this is important now is choosing a leader. At what point does by-passing defense result in more damage taken than increasing damage by 50%. The answer percentage wise is 33%. To get this, if a unit does 1000 base damage and the leader skill was ignoing defense, then you'd always do 1000 damage. If the leader skill was to up damage by 50% then you'd do 1500 damage, but that'd be reduced by 33% so the resulting damage would be 1000. As we don't know how defense really works, it's hard to see where the defense integer results in the ""33%"" answer. Also this is ignoring that the leader skills and items are ""Chance to ignore..."" as opposed to always ignore. Any light on this subject would probably help the community moving forward with choosing unit line ups. Tl;dr How does defense work exactly."

1,"If the refs called a fair game, how would the Patriots and Steelers maintain their bandwagons?","Why doesn't the NFL get rid of challenges and just have a separate group watch the game and correct bad calls? Basically, there could be another group of NFL experts who just watch the games separately from the regular refs or part of the same group. I guess it doesn't matter. Anyways, when something questionable happens they review the matter and relay the message to the on field refs. I think this would save tons of time. Also, the current system is pointless for many reasons. One of which is that certain plays are still considered to be unreviewable/challengeable. Also, it's dumb that a team has to risk losing time outs just to get a bad call reversed. Of course, the group reviewing the game could still get it wrong, but I think its better than what currently exists. Since its their job to constantly analyze every play, I think it would save time as the current refs have to stop the game and look at it themselves. If someone else's job is just to look at replays, I think it would be faster. The NHL has a form of this already."

The bike rack area at the high school nearby is bigger than the one for cars/mopeds combined. Most ""sidewalks"" *are* marked as mixed-use and they're at least 1.5m wide, and curbs are shallow and sloped (no hard curbs) so bikes can get on and off the road if necessary (and cars don't bash their rims when sucking at parallel parking). The walkways that don't have a mixed-use sign are still pretty wide, and people bike on them anyway (police care more about whether you have a front light on your bike at night than policing who's biking where). The city also regularly clears and sands the paths in winter if they go through public land (including parks and trails). Bridges are the only spots I've seen here where the pathway is divided down the middle with a line separating pedestrians and cyclists. Since its such a small city, every little incident and bar fight gets into the newspaper, and I haven't seen anything about cars hitting bikes (but then, drivers know to expect bikes everywhere), and stories I've heard about bike accidents from friends have been of them falling off their own bike on ice and not of bikes hitting pedestrians (which would result in much milder injuries than cars hitting bikes or people, so they're kind of non-stories)."

1,Wow you must be so smart look at all those big and unnecessary words,"Regardless of my IQ, I would like to preface that IQ is merely a single attribute of what makes a person. IQ facilitates quicker learning, (ideally) less errors, and allows for larger leaps to newer ideas. It's a gradient, and high IQ is like starting life with a trust fund; it makes certain things easier, but it's not going to stop you from throwing it away or doing anything remotely useful with it either. For a living I'm an entrepreneur. My favorite hobbies are riddles, video games, and prototyping random engineered creations. Favorite books are on neuroscience. I can't pick just one I'm an idiot moment. I have an abnormally high aptitude for fucking up relationships with girls. I don't know what my IQ is exactly. Once I tested at above 180, but I do not believe that test was geared towards high enough IQ's, which essentially nullifies the results. It's also an unimportant metric; it is what it is and I have no control over it. I can sleep well, remain healthy, etc to do better, but otherwise it's just a number. It's not really something to be proud of because I didn't really earn it. I can only be proud of what I do with it. Socially, it sucks because if I ever make an error, it's HURR DURR you're a genius, and if I ever do anything intelligent or remarkable it's HURR DURR we expected as much. (I still love it though, I'm hoping by the 2150's to enhance my brain with implants :p)"

1,"But he was so smart, he obviously thought like I do!","THis isn't one from everyday conversations but it still annoys me. Kant made a famous rebuttal of the ontological argument for the existence of God. People interpret that as well then, because Kant is arguing against an argument for God's existence, that means Kant is actually an atheist, obviously, and was just pretending to be a devoted christian. What is missed is that Kant was taking that argument down because it sucked and did the ""God"" cause no favours... it was actually weakening the whole religious philosophical case. But still, people really want to see Kant as a secret atheist, when he truly was a blatant and profusely anal hard core religious person."

There are some countries in the world where parents are outright forbidden from disciplining their children. The US is not one of them. We also believe that people are innocent until proven guilty. Nevertheless, I've made my position very clear; the OP should contact authorities or a trusted adult if he truly believes that his father was excessive. We can't say any more than that without misleading him."

Our coach is allowed to proctor tests if they occur during championship meets, however I consider this to be a disadvantage because I often have to take tests on a noisy bus/plane with no desk. Athletics are an enormous time commitment that require a lot of discipline and time management skills, and juggling that and school is a lot more difficult than you think. We really don't get much special treatment except the occasional extended deadline because we're missing an entire week of school which I think is quite fair. I really really love what I do, but at the end of the day I value actually learning and getting my degree way more than a sport that won't take me much farther than college."

1,I think there is something wrong with one of the rings in your title bar.,"Hi! I'm the creator of this website, and I'm thrilled to see that it's been posted here. A little background: I first had the idea to create a sortable schedule for the Olympics after I had trouble figuring out which events were broadcast live during the 2012 summer games. I could see listings in chronological order and check whether events I wanted to see were there or not, but I couldn't sort by event THEN see whether it was on TV or not. It seemed mindnumbingly simple to do, so I figured I would do something in 2014. What happened next is that I promptly forgot about it until the day before the Sochi games started then started working on it figuring it might take me a day to put something together. As it turned out, I only finished it yesterday, which means I've spent *way* more time working on a site that helps me see which events are on TV than I have on actually watching events on TV. tl;dr - I made a sortable schedule because I didn't like NBC's version, worked hard on it, and it's nice to know that at least one other person in the universe finds it useful."

I remember signing up for Gox long ago, but never used it and eventually decided to use CoinBase instead. I use LastPass to generate random password for my websites logins and noticed that I had no entry for Mt. Gox. I went back in my email and found my original verification email from 1/29/2012. I clicked on the verification link, **from over two years ago**, my account verified and I was able to set a password and then login for the first time. Apparently the Gox verification links live ""forever"". Is this what has happened to other users? They signed up for Gox and never verified. Now that the new login system is implemented, do these non-verified accounts just have blank passwords in their database? Did the Chinese hackers figure out how to generate verification URLs? I don't know, I'm just relaying my experience."

I was out with my parents yesterday, and my mom sprung this one on me when we were sitting at Burger King on the way back home. Apparently no, I can't just have a dog (previous discussion being about my potential future pets), people who only have pets are weird. She goes on and on about how cute my cousin's kids are. I just sat there in smile and nod mode during this wonderful diatribe. And then comes this gem: ""You HAVE to have a kid! No...not just one. Two. At least. You have to break this 'only child' curse we've got going in our family. Ooh, I know! Have twins!"" She practically shrieks this across the entire restaurant. My dad and I are the only only children in our entire family. Hardly a curse. Me: Um....*what*? She goes on to insist that I actually love kids, I taught ""her kids"" (ex teacher) when I was only fourteen. I did not teach them. She put me on babysitting duty while she went to Starbucks (yeah, that actually happened) or whatever else she did whenever she had me there to watch her class. And regarding my existence, I'm about 95% sure I was the result of boredom and excessive amounts of alcohol. My mom will never admit it, but my dad has dropped a few not-so-subtle hints over the years. All they ever talk about is how much fun they had before I was born...7 years after they were married.

1,"Ya the Babadook suddenly changing to stock Jurassic Park dinosaur noises halfway through the film and the sped-up film footage exorcism scene definitely screamed ""I can't believe this was made with such a small budget!""","**The Babadook** hands down is the best horror movie since that one summer when both **The Conjuring** and **You're Next** came out within a month of each other. It excels in tying the horrors of the monster with the themes and inner demons present throughout the script. While it takes half the movie to physically show the monster, its presence as in the lead's issues with depression and anxiety is felt throughout the movie. The visuals stuck with me long after I left the theater, managed to do a whole lot with a very small budget. Can see it being a future horror classic, especially once the thing inevitably hits Netflix and more people discover it. For now, it's a really easy to recommend rental on VOD. For eight bucks you support a chilling as hell movie made with a lot of passion that looks like it costed ten times as much as its actual budget."

It's definitely a good sign, but I don't think people were too concerned in general that it would be a devastating injury. It's just about how quickly he can turn it around, and if they want to risk him in a game against Baltimore where they likely weren't going to see a huge game from the RBs anyway."

Meanwhile tesla only has to use the ready made foil."

1,Yeah just like the NBA NFL etc.. People would rather be treated better than perform at the highest level..,"I think the recent Askren media brings up a broader issue that is being missed in MMA... I keep seeing a lot of talk about how Askren will never be proven as the best unless he shows it in the UFC, etc etc. But Askren was clear in the InsideMMA interview that he doesn't need (or necessarily even want) to see the UFC demolished to count that as a victory. In my opinion (which could also be wrong), I think what's being lost is that Askren's overall argument isn't that he is too good for the UFC's fights, he also clearly yields that the UFC is currently the top of the fight game... it's just that he's got convictions that *all of the fighters* in any promotion should be treated fairly, and he doesn't think that the UFC provides that to its fighters. Yes, those few who have made it to the top get treated much better, and maybe he could even get there and get some very lucrative contracts, but that is not the point (and even those at the top can quickly be turned on). Rather, the organization should treat all of it's fighters regardless of ranking with decency. I think he brings up some good points that Dana White and Zuffa would be fools to totally ignore. In the past few years it has been more and more common to hear UFC fighters publicly vocalize their complaints, HUGE fighters like GSP, and an underscore to those sentiments is often that they felt they could only speak up either once they were out of the UFC or had built enough leverage/credibility that the UFC's bully tactics couldn't outright squash them. It is no secret that most non-headliners don't get a huge purse even on PPV. It often seems to me that fighters feel (but importantly also are sort of expected to feel) gratitude early in their UFC careers towards the UFC because they've been given the chance to fight in the best fight promotion in MMA... and so far this has worked for Zuffa as they are the best promotion... They have done amazing work to build MMA as a sport, that is undeniable. But it also sort of reminds me of websites that try to scavenge free material from graphic artists, etc, by saying, well we aren't going to pay you anything but you get all this free publicity from the traffic you'll get from our website, so you should be happy with that. It is a little bit telling that Askren has been pretty well spoken and presented fairly logical and unaggressive points, but Dana White (as usual) can only argue back with pretty false logic or just shaming... seems a little bit like misdirection from the real point. I guess I just feel that now that MMA is gaining popularity and legitimacy as a sport, the UFC needs to shift its mindset away from invincible, or else other promotions will eventually grow up and suddenly there will be a more professional, more legitimate draw for some of the top fighters, and that day might not be as far off as it seems... I think it will begin to happen before another promotion is even equal to the UFC in overall competition. Dana White and the UFC are currently the big boys on the playground, but as MMA keeps growing, but pretty soon it's not a playground it's fucking college and no one gives a shit about bullies you have to be smart and decent to stay on top. /endrant Anyway, thoughts? TL:DR; I think Askren is bringing up some larger points about general treatment/respect of all fighters that the UFC should be seriously taking to heart rather than trying to bully away, or else they're going to lose their hold when MMA gets bigger."

Obviously it's not going to have the same feel as a Honda Accord (their favorite car for 2014), and they should be smart enough to get that. But to call it teeth-rattling, crazy-making rough? A lot of the other comments they use to deride the car felt exaggerated. They might be more true when applied to the STi. Did Subaru engineers tune the suspension too stiff? And I'm sorry, but ALL the new cars with electric steering feel about the same - dead and lifeless, with poor centering and mediocre road-feedback. Generally, the WRX electric steering is given high marks among cars with electric steering. Even the Mercedes vehicles are using it across their lines, and their steering suffers all the same problems. But they seem to single out the WRX while giving a free pass to everybody else."

That we come running from our ambulance to someone on the verge of death. Lol it is not like that. Most of calls that we respond to dont require EMS. Not being rude but most people that call for EMS do not understand what counts as an emergency. If you break a finger , a wrist , have a cold , feel like you have a fever , or can talk and walk ; do not call for an ambulance. But don't get me wrong , shit does hit the fan. I have a few calls that i still think about from time to time. Now about EMTs and ambulance paramedics. Here in NY you have EMTs which provide basic life support. We mostly deal with calls that have to do with trauma. Now we have our paramedics. Advance Life Support- they mostly deal with medical problems. Both EMTs and Paramedics ride on ambulances. We can be paired together or with someone on the same level. We also both respond to medical and trauma calls."

1,Let's not... you pervs.,"Let's talk about sexual shaming of men Gentlemen, I'd like to begin a discussion here about your experiences with being shamed sexually or for your sexuality by women and feminists. It is my opinion that shaming men for their sexuality by women is intentional and done for the purpose of control and a uniform behavior among women that is so prevalent it has become constant. I don't think an hour of the day passes where someone or something doesn't tell me I'm bad, disusting, stupid, a loser, or a threat for because I have sexual desires. Every woman I've dated has done the eyeroll-huff-exasperated""men!"" thing when discussing sexuality. When I was about 13, my mother took me to the history museum where we saw some ancient fertility statues. I thought they were both silly and curious. My feminist when it's convenient mother? Eyeroll-huff-exasperated ""men! all they think about is their *thing!"" Shit like that is *constant* when you're a man. So let's use this thread to discuss our experiences with being shamed for sexuality and how it has affected us. I'd also like people to offer ideas for how they think that can change or be changed."

1,"Yes, extinction is the only ethical solution.","I still don't understand why not having children is perceived as selfish. It makes no sense. Either case is a personal choice, so each option is equally selfish. There are outlying cases, but for the most part whether or not you choose to have children is a choice you make for your own reasons, not for the good of a unconceived child. Someone who has 8 kids at this point in history isn't somehow a saint of altruism. It's a choice they made because they WANT 8 children. In an abstract philosophical sense, as long as you are actively choosing either of those paths over the other without outside coercion, each of them are equally self-interested. **WARNING: PERSONAL OPINION AHEAD** All of that said, we don't live in an abstract world. In our world resources are limited and we're already heading towards exhaustion of those resources. In that environment I'd argue that choosing to have children is fundamentally a hugely selfish act. You are choosing to expand an already enormous population, purely for your own interests. As a single, childless person, I don't want to be accused publicly of selfishness by someone who chose to produce mini-clones of themselves, and then socialize most of the costs of those mini-me's (societal, environmental, financial) to people like myself. I'm happy to pay taxes and I'm fine with you choosing to have kids. Just don't call me selfish for not out-growing the planet with my own clones while I'm paying for your kids schooling."

1,"Because every person without kids is in shape, and every person with kids is not.","Apparently I'm in good shape because I don't have kids Happened to reconnect a couple of acquaintances from college last week. One was a good friend I knew from my classes, the other was a girl he was dating then, has married since and had two kids with. I haven't been on Facebook in years, so it was a bit of a surprise to see how much she had changed - I recall her looking quite attractive in college, but now she looked surprisingly aged (if I hadn't known she was my age, I'd have guessed her to be in her mid 30s) and was rather overweight. We're chatting over dinner and catching up on various things, and she comments on how good I look and in even better shape since college. Her husband asks about my gym routine, and I mention that I'm still pretty dedicated and now take lifting and healthy eating more seriously than I did in college (when it was an on-off thing.) He's talking about how he's trying to get back into biking shape and asking me what I usually do at the gym, when suddenly the mommyjack begins. ""But you know, you don't have kids, and you're not home with them half the day - so it must be so much easier to stay in shape."" ""uh... what?"" ""Yeah, it's IMPOSSIBLE to actually make time to run or do yoga or anything like that when you have two toddlers running around the house most of the time."" ""Actually, it's not-"" ""I mean, you'll find out how tough it is some day when you have kids of your own, if you're ever staying at home with them. But when the older one wants chicken nuggets or pizza for lunch every day, or we're going out for things like ice cream or burgers, it's so much harder to really say no and watch calories."" ""..."" Cue the story of just how difficult and exhausting the life of the stay at home mom with 2 kids really is, and how privileged I am that I get time to go to the gym oh so leisurely with no other burdens in my life. So far I'm holding my tongue and not pointing out her bad case of fork-pickupitis and keeping my eyes from rolling at the fact that she was the only one of us looking at the dessert menu. ""And now it's only getting worse, with Mikey starting school this year I need to be up at 6 in the mornings to get ready."" Finally I gave in. ""I get up at 5:30 to hit the gym before work. I know other parents who use my gym at the same time too. Your kids aren't a goddamn excuse. You're just rationalizing."" I think she said three words to me the rest of the evening. Her husband, much to my amusement, seemed to enjoy her silence and he and I had fun catching up."
1,"Yes, Paladin needs a nerf","Blizzard should hire that guy! Also: I totally agree that the game is most fun if it is about playing minions and effective trading. What kills this fun a lot for me, and I guess also for many others out there are these kind of decks that never really care about board presents, since they can control everything with swipes, silences, removals, etc. from their hand. These are not only the most boring and frustrating decks to play against, but are also the strongest decks in the game, which is why so many people are playing them. One step in the right direction in my opinion would be to considerably weaken any kind of swipes. To mention an example: Equality + Consecration is awfully boring to play against. One of the better designed swipe spells in my opinion is Brawl, since it always leaves the option that the enemy will still have that one phatty on the board afterwards. Another option would be, to make strong swipe spells legendary, so that they could only be in the deck once, meaning that there is a much smaller chance that you have the spell (/combo) early enough in the game."

The Highway Patrol captain in question gave several tips for dealing with a traffic stop when concerned for your safety, including what constitutes a legitimate reason for an officer to ask you to come back to his car and when you should call the authorities. At the end of the segment, the reporter claimed that he also said that his best tip was to follow traffic laws so you don't get pulled over in the first place. Now, I have no doubt Captain Brown said that; police are generally in favor of abiding by the law. But ""follow the law and you won't get raped"" is not close to what he said, even out of context. You have to force it into a completely different part of the dialogue to make it work. (Notice that Huffington Post didn't post the video as part of their ""coverage"")."

1,You don't understand - being a whore is *empowering*.,"Tinder. Let me explain; I do get that sometimes we just need to get off and a media platform like this might be the most efficient way to hook up with someone you find attractive. I understand why people use it and I would never judge anyone from using it for casual sex. However, casual sex is really really weird to me. I have trouble separating intimacy and sensation at that level. Having an app that speeds up the process of building that trust between people to see each other in that state is just so mind blowing."

I just got into a beautiful relationship with someone who I truly love. I am so happy when he is around. He understands me on a level that no one else does. Not even my own family. But when I'm alone, it's as though someone literally took my own source of happiness away from me. I don't want to be so dependent on him, but I can't control it. Some days, I wake up absolutely depressed for no rhyme or reason. I am usually easily excited and I can cheer myself up pretty quick. But the ""down"" periods are getting longer. They are getting worse. I can't seem to snap out of it. I find myself having severe mood swings. I'd be watching or reading something online and suddenly, I'm having a total meltdown. Suicidal thoughts and everything. A month ago, I tried to kill myself. When I didn't, I felt like a total failure. Like I was coward for not being able to go through with it. I tried to stay away from those thoughts. But now they are back again. It couldn't come at a worse time, because it is ruining my drive to study and spend time with my wonderful new boyfriend. I tried talking to him about it, but that conversation hurts me way too much. When I told him I was having suicidal thoughts again, I hugged me so tight and started tearing up on the spot. How could I bear to drag him into this mess? I'm so tired. TL;DR My depression is affecting my new relationship and studies. Mood swings getting worse. Suicidal thoughts are back."

Yesterday I went to an MC's ""party"" on a small village (just people riding their bikes there, the most of them guys on their sportsbikes, where 90% are in an MC, and listening to a concert), and I sort of could feel that me, being on a 50cc don't get as ""included"" as someone with a 600 or so. Also, when riding I don't really know whether riders here just don't wave at each other, or if other riders don't wave at me because I'm a ""kid"" (18) on a small bike. Maybe if some day a rider saw me stranded on the side of the road, he would likely help me, but I still think I don't get the full side of the camaraderie as riders riding a liter class sportsbike get. What are your thoughts?"

Hard winters but if you stay closer to Lake Superior they get easier. Lots of unmanned camps and cottages you could ""access"" in winter for supplies that you cant normally come by. Even if its wrong, I'd break and steal if it was absolutely necessary. No shortage of firewood, plenty of places to move to, etc. Due to super low funding, theres virtually no conservation officers/game wardens in the area.

The bishop got up and announced how we had a great turnout for a service project and how well it went. After which he proceeded to scold us about how we could have done better, more people could have shown up, etc. It suddenly dawned on me that it would never be enough. I was already expected to: * Contribute significant time to a calling (I was a counselor in the YMP, had been in the EQP, seminary teacher, etc.) * Support my wife as she also contributed significant time to her calling (she was YWP at the time) * Home teach five families every month * Attend all regular meetings * Attend ward and stake functions and training (btw, anyone else ever scratch their heads at their training sessions? I never came away feeling like I had been trained to do anything.) * Clean the church building * Feed the missionaries on a regular basis * Have an investigator for them to teach * Give a generous fast offering every month * Give 10% of my income I suddenly realized that all they would ever do was take from me and tell me it wasn't good enough, that **I** wasn't good enough, but if I kept giving then maybe, *maybe*, **maybe** I would reap an amazing reward in the hereafter. It was after that that I started having very negative feelings about church. Funny thing is that I felt super guilty for it. I decided to do something I had always wanted to do and learn more about Joseph Smith as a way of getting back into the gospel. I ordered Rough Stone Rolling. And that's when I learned a new word: ""polyandry"". It was all downhill from there."

1,"Yeah, you're right, he definitely didn't seize it with 7 catches for 127 yards and 2 touchdowns in the Super Bowl","You're right. He had the golden opportunity, but couldn't seize it. And his contract is not favorable to the team, especially considering his drop-off in production from the Larry Fitz we expect. That said, the man is a class act and seems like a genuinely nice guy. This coupled with the facts that he is still a solid receiver and was at one point an elite receiver, makes people inclined to answer with his name in topics like these. I for one agree with them. While I wouldn't want the Giants to lose, if Larry and the Cards beat the Giants on the way to the Superbowl, I could make peace with it."

1,I'll see you in a week complaining about incompetent teammates,This was a truly phenomenal interview. Dandy is truly humble. The way he credits his mastery of jungle is 100% to his team and the cooperation / synergy they have created. That is exactly what NA is lacking. It takes a team to create a truly great player and connections / bonds. I believe after watching this interview being humble and focusing more on teamwork is the way to success it really has changed my outlook on league of legends and the dreaded solo q. Thank you for the great interview thoorin please continue your work in E-sports.

1,Roberto Aguayo in the first round.,"What do you think will be our biggest position of need in next year's draft? I see this team, and I see an extremely balanced team. I'll try to break it down: QB - I'm one of the biggest Tannehill homers out there, but I don't see why we would want to use a first round pick on Tannehill unless he really slumps. He has a history of getting better as the season goes on, going back to his college years, and I don't see how we would want a first rounder here. I can see us grabbing a late round pick as a back-up, if the talent is there and Moore is not re-signed. **WR** - We don't have a big body receiver, but our WR group has been pretty good so far. The fact that Tannehill usually has receptions by 8 different people in the roster shows that it is an extremely dependable group. Even still, if someone like Dorial Green-Beckham or Devin Funchess falls through the cracks, this may be the route we go. OL - We seem to be pretty set (dafuq?) here. I like the combination of Albert, Colledge, Satele (wat), Pouncey and James here. They may not be perfect, but not something I would consider spending a first rounder on. RB - I can see this being a third round pick for us. I really like Lamar Miller, but I don't think he is a ""most snaps"" kind of guy. Damien Williams and Daniel Thomas have also been great RBs so far this season. It depends on our cap situation at the moment, but I like our current RBs set, with the O-line we have. **TE** - MAYBE. If Charles Clay can keep playing like he did against the Bears, then only spend a mid round pick. If he is still struggling, maybe we should consider it. I largely think the offense needs a big more tweaking, but let's still go over our defense. D-Line: Almost untouchable. Vernon, Wake, Mitchell, Starks and Odrick make for the best D-line this team has seen in ages. With Dion Jordan coming back, I think we're more than set here. LBs - Our LB corps is now seem to be clicking with Wheeler being our SLB, Jenkins as our WLB, and Misi slowly but surely re-adjusting to MLB and injuries. I used to hate this group going into the season and early, but now I really like it. CBs - Grimes and Finnegan will still be with us next year, and I fucking adore them (although Grimes is not as good as last year). I'm starting to really like Will Davis ball hawkiness, and while Taylor has had a couple of weird penalties, I think he can develop into a starter if he matures. Could be better, but could be much worse too. S - Louis Delmas is proving every Lions fan out there who shat on the pick wrong. I like what he has done, but I really hope he can finish off the season with his injury concerns, and him playing as many snaps as he has. With Reshad Jones having a strong LB group to help him, he is back on track to being one of the best in the league. It's scary how loaded and deep this group is, but I just may be a homer. I think WR is our neediest group, and that's mainly because we don't have a ""scary"" WR that defenses can focus on. We may afford to draft BPA (Best Player Available) on the first round! How do you guys feel about it? Do you think I may be giving someone too long of a leash?"

1,"But it's 3-D printed, so it's automatically good, right?","This is not a graphene battery, it's a carbon-filled thermoplastic battery. Cool stuff, I guess, but calling it graphene is all #hype crap. They're basically coating thermoplastic filaments with carbon-fluid and letting it dry (or whatever they do to get rid of the liquid carrier), then melting the carbon-coated filaments for basic filament printing. You can tell at a glance that it's not really graphene (from a purist's definition - monolayer graphene is transparent). If they're trying to go for actual graphene batteries, and not just the hype surrounding calling something graphene, they're doing it completely wrong. They're never going to produce true graphene by mixing nanopellets, and they'd never be able to layer graphene properly with filament printing. If, however, they're trying to make a comparatively weaker-capacity battery than real graphene that can withstand more of a beating than current batteries, then they're heading down the right track. It may be a successful middle-ground, idk, but calling it graphene really ruins when a true graphene battery is made. A let down, IMO."

If you fall asleep in the jungles of Vietnam and an opposing soldier pokes you to see if you're alive, if you just wake up, they shoot you. You have to be ready to attack out of a dead sleep. This was Vietnam era training, but I'm sure people who serving in hot areas of Afghanistan/ Iraq probably have very similar responses. Waking up to a loud crash of a door being kicked down would have many people grabbing their gun from under their bed as a default response."

1,It's totally your fault for not MacGyverinn any up!,"The demand exceeded the supply? Yes, that's definitely my fault. When I was in college I worked at the wine bar located inside a live performance theatre. A majority of the theatre's patrons were senior citizens, so we offered free hearing devices that amplified sound as a courtesy. For some reason it was decided that the wine bar was the best place to have these devices (rather than, say, coat check), so I was often in charge of them. The theatre had about 30 of these devices, which was usually enough. However, one night a gentleman approached me at 5 minutes till curtain and asked for a hearing device. I told him that they had all been checked out already. He was understandably annoyed, but did not yell at me, which I was thankful for because I couldn't have produced one out of thin air no matter what he said. At 2 minutes till curtain I began shutting down the bar, as is customary. Then I looked up to see my manager, red faced and storming up to my bar, with the device-less man in tow. I started to get worried, as my manager had a quick temper and snapped at us easily. **Manager:** *in a shaky, angry voice* Did you tell this gentleman that we were out of hearing devices? **Me:** Yes, they've all been... **Manager:** DON'T YOU EVER **EVER** TELL A CUSTOMER WE ARE OUT OF SOMETHING! **DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?!?!?!** At this point, all I could do was stand there and stutter. I'd never been yelled at that angrily by anyone in my life (and my father was a yeller!). My manager was a tall man, and he stood looming over my petite self with what I can only describe as beams of pure rage shooting from his eyes. Before I could produce a real answer, he shoved me aside and threw open the cabinet where we kept the devices, but only found the numbered tags inside. Then he stalked back across the lobby wordlessly and the customer followed him again. About 20 minutes later I was called into the manager's office. The customer and his wife had asked for refunds on their tickets and I was getting written up for actively driving customers away. My manager was no longer yelling, he had calmed down by this point. As he handed me the write-up he said nonchalantly, ""It's a good thing this is your first infraction, otherwise you'd be paying the cost of the tickets as well."" That manager quit not long after."

Since it is apparent that Lucina has the exact moveset as Marth, she is undeniably a clone. The problem this gives me is that either she or Marth will be better than the other, making the remaining one a mere novelty, much like Roy and Marth in melee. Other than having her take up a character slot, Lucina could have been switched out for Chrom as a standalone character, with her being a part of Robin's final smash. Or, she could have simply been an alternate form for Marth. This is lame as it stands right now, but we'll have to wait and see how it pans out. All I can say is that Sakurai is a master troll."

I am neither for nor against any political system so let's not bother talking about it further. I have myself been in the position where I was told to hide my income, reasons I am for it. - Does not cause jealous anger amongst employees - You earned it through hard work and dedication - Why is it anyone's business what I earn besides my own and my employers So now you understand, it is not for any mischievous act you are conspiring to concoct. It is because it is healthier for a company to function without animosity and if the person is getting a raise, they either earned it, in which case, good for them, or it is because they are related or best pals with the boss, in which case again, too bad for you.

There is nothing more discouraging than getting frustrated because you're having a tough time learning because you're unable to make your fingers do things they aren't already used to doing on something that is incredibly challenging to play because the action is way to high and it won't stay in tune.

I know a lot of people are hating on Israel but this is war, this is a new era of war with different tactics. War and fighting evolves over time and it's no longer big armies fighting big armies. It's usually a well defined army vs guerrilla ware fare. In almost all cases the smaller army wins because they can hide and strike at the right time. It is impossible for Israel to target only Hamas fighters. I don't think any army has a good plan of fighting against this type of warfare. Israel is using the show no mercy tactic because it might be the only way to win this type of war. Yes it is very unfortunate for children to die but it may end up being the only way to win the war. Hamas is like cancer in Gaza. You can't directly target only cancer other parts have to suffer too in order to get rid of it. You may not agree with me but if you have a better solution to stop Hamas let me know, I'd be happy to hear your take on it"

You must spend the time to de-water and filter/centrifuge out the crap. Then you either convert it into biodiesel, or you make some modifications to your vehicle to allow it to run on veggie oil. Here is the thing, if you are not running on biodiesel, you still need to buy diesel. You use the diesel to start the engine, then switch to pre-heated veggie oil - when done driving you switch back to diesel. If you don't do this, your engine becomes nearly impossible to start unless in a tropical climate. It also gunks your oil. All that time caring for the system, gathering and treating the oil becomes a job. All for some diesel, which you can buy with money."

Currently I can run my DK2 on my non-gaming laptop but I doubt that will be the case with the CV1. From a college student/developer on a budget's standpoint I'm against another increase and am fine where the DK2 is for now. I feel like making the hardware more taxing will shut out a huge market for the product. One of my main concerns about the potential upgrade is the client's budget -- the people I see that could benefit the most out of using the Rift, in my opinion, are Schools. Imagine all of the educational possibilities. How neat would it have been to shrink down to mere nano-meters in High School Biology to observe how a cell works? Or in Physics to go into outer space and run observable simulations? It would be a whole lot easier to obtain if they could spend USD $450 per headset/GPU upgrade than $500~600. I'm aware that colleges will be able to afford the expensive hardware to run the CV1 at 90hz with 4k, but I think that Oculus would be missing a huge opportunity by cutting out middle-end PC users and people that can't afford to upgrade. Maybe they might offer cheaper, lower spec models for budget conscious individuals? Just something to think about. If you disagree, could you please tell me why? What market, that isn't gamers, do you think will be able to use the CV1?"

Look at the top comment under that article: *When Dan Snyder lets go of his crush on Bob, maybe the team will get back to playing the best players and not the most popular names who sell the most jerseys.* I fucking hate our fans.

I now drive it 50% of the time. Over the past 2 years the following has happened: - Rear end is way out of alignment and has no adjustment and makes a big knock every time you turn a corner because the centre bush is worn away. - The plastic linkages for the shifter on the gearbox wore away also so couldn't select reverse. This was expensive to fix. - The spark plugs had probably never been changed (115,000km) so the car would struggle and nearly stall if you didn't shift gears at really high rpm. - One day driving along a structural arm (not sure on exact naming) holding the rear right wheel in place just snapped. This was also expensive to fix. - The boot door always falls on my head when loading/unloading because the gas struts are failing. - Brake lights don't work (fuse repeatedly blows) - Central locking no longer works. TLDR: This car is a constant splinter in my mind."

1,We don't know if Satoshi is alive.,"So, I was looking at some basic characteristics of a cult... The group is focused on a living leader to whom members seem to display excessively zealous, unquestioning commitment. The group is preoccupied with bringing in new members. The group is preoccupied with making money. Questioning, doubt, and dissent are discouraged or even punished. The group is elitist, claiming a special, exalted status for itself, its leader(s), and members (for example: the leader is considered the Messiah or an avatar; the group and/or the leader has a special mission to save humanity). The group has a polarized us-versus-them mentality, which causes conflict with the wider society. The group's leader is not accountable to any authorities (as are, for example, military commanders and ministers, priests, monks, and rabbis of mainstream denominations). The group teaches or implies that its supposedly exalted ends justify means that members would have considered unethical before joining the group (for example: collecting money for bogus charities). Members' subservience to the group causes them to cut ties with family and friends, and to give up personal goals and activities that were of interest before joining the group. Members are expected to devote inordinate amounts of time to the group. Members are encouraged or required to live and/or socialize only with other group members."

So when I went to school, I went there thinking I was a genius in a shitty world--and so when people didn't like me, it must have been *their problem*.

I say ""what the hell is going on? I'm not signing that till you tell me whats going on"" ""Mr. XXX We've had a report of you performing some sexual harassment "" ""Ok could you explain why I'm being charged?"" ""Nope sorry can't do that"" ""Ok could you explain who is accusing me"" ""Nope sorry can't do that"" In other words I got sacked at my work because someone filed a sexual harasment charge against me. And to make matters worse they won't let you know who the claimant is to ""protect the victim"" Anyhow. I ended up just quitting myself right on the spot and told them it was a bunch of bull shit what they are doing at this place. This is exactly how women can get their way in the workplace and why you should be reading TRP and how men are basically at the mercy of all women in the workplace. If someone doesn't like you? Sexual harassment charge. There really is no way to fight it. even if you have a good lawyer. It's white knighting at it's finest."

However the fix I just discovered I'd only seen talked about briefly, but it was my PRIMARY issue. In your video settings, reduce your view distance to the MINIMUM while leaving your graphics details settings where you normally would keep it (for me I run at ultra high detail). I'm able to pull my normal 60 FPS with just my view distance sliders reduced to minimum. Until a fix comes out for that, I'm able to play perfectly fine now. The 4th slider (max camera follow distance) doesn't matter, you can leave that at 32 as it doesn't affect rendering. Hope this helps!

1,"Yes, we should add in a feature which requires a great deal of teamwork to one of the most toxic game environments of all time, and expect it to go over well.","Siege Weapons and Team-bought items in League? So I was thinking today, and I had what I thought was a rather novel, if not good, idea. Now, the following post will be somewhat lengthy and may hint at some ideas (or explicitly say some ideas) which are not balanced. That is to be expected, as I am not a game designer. What if siege weapons were in league? What I mean is this: Suppose there was an item, call it ""the battering ram."" This is not an item that goes in any one slot but is instead a new ""unit"" on the map which can be controlled by one selected player. This unit would cost x amount of gold distributed between the 5 players in really any way. (Brief note: for balancing there would probably have to be a minimum contribution amount per player to prevent support spam). This unit would be melee range and would have the ability to 3 or 4 shot turrets. But, this item would be extremely vulnerable and would be bought at the expense of actual slotted items for the players. (Brief note: A possibility would be that such an item, if bought and destroyed, could be repurchased at half-price). This would open up some interesting strategic possibilities. ""Do we sacrifice individual strength for significant early (or late) pressure, etc.?"" ""Oh, this Renekton got ahead in lane, so instead of getting him snowballing into mid game, lets use the fact that he doesnt have great scaling and invest some of his gold into a siege weapon!"" Now this is just one example of a siege or team-bought item. Now, there could also be others, like mini turrets that would be cheap (relatively) but would be placed around the map as pseudo-wards which functioned essentiallly as Heimerdinger turrets. This way, ward battles could be WARD BATTLES and also perimeters could be more easily set up. Also, one could consider more defensive team purchases such as essentially three Thresh walls surrounding the base (one at each turret) which reactivates every so often and goes down when someone on the other team enters. This would make defending temporarily easier at the expense of individual strength. But again, these are just some ideas. Any thoughts on viability or strategies regarding these teambought items? tl;dr: Siege weapons in League? No way! What if you could buy siege weapons as a team or other extra-slot items as a team to either be offensive or defensive? Read more to find out."

Even studies that take in the non-use values associated with these events (see Atkinson et al on the London Olympics) don't always suggest they will fully recoup the costs. Also, cost overruns are something that need to be fixed, whether it is for sporting events or transport infrastructure. It is a big part of the problem."

1,"Leaving us hanging like this is rude, ya know.","Not So Sweet Tales - Intro to the Insanity Hello folks! I used to work at a candy store, and it was there that I met the most batshit-insane and entitled woman I have ever had the misfortune of being forced to work with. Let's call her AwHellNah. It was a favorite saying of hers. At this candy store, we sold exquisite truffles. They were all handmade, one of a kind, and covered in 24k gold. Yes, they were that fancy. So they were pricy, and tiny. And every morning/evening we'd wheel them in on a slightly busted cart to and from the cooler. Well, AwHellNah never liked to pay attention and do things slowly. Her style was to do thinks quick and sloppily so she could leave her section unattended and go chat with her friends. Or snack on the multitudes of fast food she would bring behind the counter, and then leave her garbage strewn about. Even though there was two trash cans right there! She'd just leave her McD's for the next person on shift to deal with. So, one morning I come in for my shift, and I go to get a cart. The morning manager stops me and tells me I need to be reeeeally careful. ""Eh?"" I ask confusedly. ""Extra careful? Always am."" ""No, I mean it."" he insists. ""AwHellNah was taking out the truffles yesterday and spilled $400 worth."" ""Holy shit! What happened?"" ""The cart got caught on the corner of the cooler apparently. I don't really know how she did it."" ""Ok, I'll be careful. What happened to AwHellNah?"" He waved his hand. ""Eh, nothing, it was an accident."" Fair enough, I continue doing my job. This was the first time any truffles had been lost. Come in 3 weeks later. Go to take out a cart to put away the truffles, and the night manager stops me with a shake of her head. ""Didn't you hear? Two days ago AwHellNah spilled another $400 worth of truffles. She say's it was the cart's wobbly wheel."" ""Woah! Are you kidding?"" ""Nope, you'll have to take all 100+ different truffle trays back by hand."" ""Will I at least get more time to close?"" ""Nope, and the bosses don't want you to go into overtime either. So you better hustle!"" For three months, every one of us had to carefully carry each tray and gently deposit it in the cooler, then sprint back to pick up a new tray and slowly walk it back, and repeat 50 times. We got chastised if we went overtime, so we often begged our coworkers to help us out instead of doing their own thing. I come in two weeks later to the head manager spitting mad. $100 of truffles had to be damaged out, thanks to someone using the carts and spilling them. Of course it was AwHellNah. Sassy (a coworker of mine) reports that not the day before when he and AwHellNah were on shift together, he had seen her using the carts and told her we weren't supposed to use them anymore. ""Why should I give a *damn*? I mean, they want me to carry all them little trays back one by one? Aw *hell* nah. I'm careful, the carts are fine. Back the fuck off."" He backed the fuck off, and woooo the obvious happened. Now, I would like to restate that none of us had ever lost one truffle using the carts but her, because she would drive like a drunken maniac. Oh, and did she get a single warning for wrecking over $1000 worth of mercy? **No.** She did not. There was a reason for that, just like there was a reason for her never getting a warning for the other stuff she pulled. Because the worst was yet to come."

If they'd done that they could have easily demanded occupation rights postwar. Who can say if they'd ever have left with half of Japan to rule? The other plan, if Japan hadn't surrendered at two, was to deploy up to five more and have troops, not just US but from the UK, Australians, New Zealanders and plenty of others, on the ground at ground zero within 48 hours. We'd all have two heads if that had gone down."

I grew up upper middle class and never had to work or worry a day in my sheltered, privileged upbringing. I still can't believe how naive and ignorant I was. Then I dropped out of college and chose to move on my own across the country where I worked a shitty minimum wage job and struggled to feed myself and pay my rent. I met a lot of other people from not so upper middle class backgrounds and I learned a lot about the cycle of poverty. I lived around a ton of homeless people: children, teens, veterans, regular adults and heard a lot of their stories. It was quite eye opening and my stance on government fiscal policy went from one end of the spectrum, to the other end pretty quick."

1,Because weather manipulation works *so* well for Storm whenever she fights magneto,"That depends a bit on how his powers actually work. I based his weather manipulation on the story where he calms the storm to save the people of that boat. He can calm the storm, but we never see him conjure any sort of weather himself, so maybe he was just using some kind of energy absorption to dissipate the storm. His healing ability can be used on others, but its not clear if he can use it on himself, because the only time he has a real opportunity to demonstrate it (the crucifixion), he would have been deliberately holding back so that he could fulfill his destiny to die on the cross. The power that I have the foggiest picture of is definitely the matter duplication though. I based it on the story where he is magically able to feed a large crowd of travelers with only a few loaves of bread and about as many fish. But can he duplicate anything else with this ability? Do the things he duplicates have be specifically organic? Inanimate? Maybe he can only duplicate food. Anyone with more bible knowledge wanna help? Anyways, his pain tolerance and healing would basically make him shrug off lethal blows like Wolverine. First he would copy himself 1000 times, or however many Jesi it takes to feed a crowd of travelers. Then the Army of Jesuses, led by Jesus Prime, would use their collective weather controlling abilities to conjure 1000 tornadoes right on Magneto's face. Jesus:1000 Magneto:0"

Also this weekend- Wildstar beta, major FF14 patch 2.2, Diablo 3 expansion weekend. In the past every single 2x xp weekend has coincided with events from other major games like a league of legends event and it really makes me wonder if it's not intentional. Soe, if you're forcing me to pick and choose, I'm not going to be playing the game as much as you're wanting me to and you're not going to be selling as many memberships to people who are also splitting their time. I don't know if this is some kind of strategy, but for me all it does is take a weekend I would have spent playing ps2 if there weren't major conflicts and because of them leaves me only going on for a couple of hours if at all. It's nice that they're doing the monthly xp events like the community asked but it really just tears at me as a gamer that everything is always planned for the same dates."
1,TIL: We need taxes.,This seems to highlight a main problem I noticed recently when I heard that Bitcoins are now taxable. It seems like human society depends on cooperation to succeed at anything and solve problems. For cooperation there needs to exist trust. Cryptocurrency assumes a 0 trust environment and is designed to operate without even considering it. It bypasses it by taking trust out of the hands of the operators and placing in the hands of computers. Anonymity is possible since you no longer need to trust the person you are dealing with. This might remove large chunks of the economy from the community and wants to by design really. We need taxes and pooling of resources on some level for society to function. If even 10% of this cooperative pool in the form of money and so taxes was removed it would probably have a big negative impact. Also this society of 0 trust and anonymity can sink even lower with people who know how to use computers to take advantages of built in features of the system like we see here. I was so excited about the potential for individual privacy and liberation from existing monetary problems in a rigged system but the end game for cryptocurrencies might actually be worse. This is just the beginning of an observation and not completely worked out but I just wanted to type it out anyway.

1,"Because we all know when the government wants something from weak individuals, they buy it from them","Generally, it's left from center. Ideologically, it's used to mean that utilities are publicly owned (owned by the government) and workers own the means of production, to separate it from capitalism where utilities are privately owned (owned by companies) and the employers own the means of production. Say you have a factory job. Under a socialist system, the machine you use is yours, whereas under capitalism the machine is the factory's and you're using it with their permission. This has some interesting implications. If you have a problem with your employer, you can refuse to come in and use your machine, and many people can go on strike like this or threaten to in order to pressure your employer to cooperate. This is called collective bargaining. Under capitalism, your employer could hire people out from under you to man your machine, since they own it and can do what they want with it. Under socialism, the machine is yours, so they can't do that unless they buy it from you, which gives you a greater advantage over them."

1,"Yes, going to TPD has proven to be a much better route than complaining to the football people","There were elements that did sound very exaggerated--for example his spiel regarding the rape of the land south of the university by the Seminoles Boosters because they put up a few developments. What really happened is they build a few condos and apartment buildings on mostly vacant land. The arts district remained perfectly intact. He had a very clear agenda. If that woman was physically threatened by those players she should have gone to the police immediately rather than trying to complain to the football people. That's a very serious situation and it was either not as serious as he made it sound and she just told her boss about it or it was serious and she took the wrong course of action. It was very opportunistic publishing with this story. If that was all true it could have been published at any time and it would have gotten attention, but he for some reason chose to dredge up those anecdotes during the peak of FSU player conduct criticism. That tells me that he didn't really care all that much about what was going on."

The reason they are considered loonies is because a lot of them suffer from mental illnesses, that's why they're called crazy. I'd also like to know what they were right about. Making 100 broad, baseless accusations and one of them turning out to be true doesn't make you right, especially when you don't say anything specific. NSA spying was known since the early 2000s, conspiratards don't get to claim that they knew about it when everyone already knew about it.

1,"Wait, so you're saying there's more protections in place for consumers than just a 4.5+ star rating on Lyft?","You may not like it, but there are laws in place to protect consumers with include requiring commercial drivers to obtain a commercial license, commercial insurance, vehicle inspections and criminal background checks. These rules were not put in place to protect the good old boys, they were put in place for protection of the users. You have to prove you know how to render commercial service for the vehicle class you use, you have to provide real commercial insurance in case you screw up, vehicle inspections make sure that the car you're riding in is reasonably safe, you should be able to know if your driver (who you're often trusting to take you safely, by yourself to some location, such as your home) is a criminal or not. All that said, if Lyft wants to operate in St. Louis, it's not all that hard. A class E license is just a $35 fee and a written test, provide background check, insurance and vehicle inspection proof to the MTC and get your license for $100. Not a huge deal and not really that expensive. BUT, those are the laws. If you don't like them, get them changed, but don't expect to be able to just ignore them just because you think you can do it faster/better/cheaper. Those are the ground rules that everyone plays by and for good reason. Without those simple laws in place, anybody could operate a taxi, and you as a consumer would not know until it's too late if their car doesn't work, their meters are rigged, the guy is a serial rapist, you know, moderately important things to be somewhat confident of before you jump in a 1,500lb machine with a stranger and go hurtling down the road at 60 miles an hour."

I missed all of your posts, but it enabled me to concentrate so much more on my journey. We have overcome so many set backs, and I am so happy all of everyone's prayers paid off. I cannot put into words the feeling of joy as I watched all four of my children walk through the waters of baptism, accept their light of the world, and take on the new garmet. All my years of failing of a father, I have never been prouder. But, there is more. My wife and I were confirmed. Side by side, we took the blessing of the father. He welcomed us to the Church, and annointed our heads with the Holy Spirit to continue His help on our journey called life. But, there is more. We were in full communion, and the blood of Christ had a sweetness I cannot explain. The rush of emotion was almost too much to take. Anyone that is contemplating whether the Church is right for you, please know, that it is even better than you are contemplating. Pope Francis is that awesome, and more. Reconciliation is the greatest sense of healing you will ever have. Most importantly, know that your life will truly be changed. I almost lost my wife through a surgery. My sponser did lose his wife to cancer, but through his love he stood by my side. We have been robbed. Parts of my family disowned me, and called my children bastards to their face. The world is truly an ugly place, but do not fret because I can testify that nothing of this world can turn yourself away from the journey except your own decision to do so. God will push you through the valley of death. If you wish to travel through the RCIA program, make the appointment today. Again, I thank everyone that said prayers for the newly welcomed members of the Church during Easter Vigil. I felt them all, and I haven't been able to stop smiling. As the father said, we have only just begun, but it is so encouraging to know where I am. I am truly blessed to be alive. May the Lord bless your day."

My grandfather is gifting me three handguns, 2 S&amp;W revolvers he purchased in the late 60's and a Walther P38 his father bought off a guy he knew sometime after the war. The Walther has no paperwork and has never been registered anywhere (we live in MD). My grandfather is an retired police officer and had the serial number checked out many decades ago by the firearms expert in his department to make sure it wasn't ever used in a crime and it came back clean. My question is, we plan on doing a legal transfer through the state police on the two S&amp;W revolvers, but what should I do about the Walther? He technically has no proof of ownership. Thanks in advance for any advice!"

The mirakuru is a miracle drug, now think to yourself, how would a Japanese anime character say 'miracle', there is only one outcome, that is MIRAKURU. So the Japanese soldies who had a drug and named it 'miracle' but pronounced it as Mirakuru, so that is what the doctor called it since he did not have years of anime experience like me(what a amateur).

When you stop drinking the first few days you cant sleep much at all since the little gaba you do have doesnt fill in enough of your down regulated gaba receptors, glutamate is rebounding here also which makes you agitated. Once the your brain stabalises a bit, your body plays catch up on REM / deep sleep which is why its hard to get out of bed. this second stage lasted about a month or two for me."

I wish I could just press a button and be in a relationship but I know that's not how it works. When I first started on OKC, I was a bit picky with who I messaged just because I wanted to make sure we'd be a decent match before I went on a date. But that really didn't lead to much, so I'm trying a ""shotgun"" approach where I send a message if I just think that person is interesting and see where it'll go from there. But that leads to quite a few first dates and then usually fading, or lack of interest, etc. Frankly, it's just tiring. Dates are not something I enjoy because I'm never 100% myself around strangers. I'm completely different when I'm comfortable around someone vs. just meeting them for the first time. Suffice to say this isn't ideally when dating. I know I'm not the only person out there who doesn't really enjoy dating. So, those who fit that category, what have you done to make OKC work better for you? Thanks!"

I always opted to clean the men's and would try to bribe people to take care of the female bathroom. The stench of pee is usually overwhelming, followed by the amounts of it you find all over the place..... How a woman is able to not only pee all over the toilet seat, but then also manages to pee on the part of the toilet that you don't even sit on (for an automated flushing toilet, you'll find the flush button where I am referencing), you also end up finding pee all over the floor - in front of, on both sides, and sometimes even behind the toilet.... I, I just don't get it! I can't even picture how someone can do a simple 'hover over a toilet' and result in pissing **EVERYWHERE**. My office has the bathrooms separated by sex, but for the longest time, half of us females would wait till all the men were gone so we could use their restroom. The nasty 'women' that were in our office at the time would leave toilets and floors submerged in piss / toilets over flowing with disinergrated shit and toilet paper / or used tampons or pads would be left on the sink counter or on top of the bin inside the stall that you are actually supposed to **put them in**...... Some women are just nasty creatures. ... Although, it did result in a lot of amusement - our bathroom has been covered with notes and drawings for the last year or so, instructing people: A) Your mother does not live here. Clean up your shit and piss. B) We do not get paid to clean up other co-workers piss, shit, and blood rags. C) To either learn how to use the toilet or go outside like the animal they are. D) Threatening people that we will release the Kracken"

1,You must be so fun at parties.,"No, treat her like a human being. Hookers, strippers and sex-workers get treated in ways that people wouldn't dare treat anyone else. You wouldn't ask a fancy restaurant for a free sample to see if they're worthy of your patronage. You wouldn't agree on a price for a haircut and then refuse to pay after it's done. Yet people think it's acceptable to treat sex-workers as sub-human. The hooker is offering a service. You're not doing her a favour by fucking her. So treat her like you would any other human being in a professional context."

Science has been wrong in the past, but each time it was wrong was a stepping stone to being less wrong. And the only thing science cares about is data, it has no ax to grind, so no one should feel attacked by science. If they think the findings are suspect, go redo the science yourself, but dismissing the outcomes and conclusions on any basis other than evidence is bad thinking."

If i get in a catastrophic accident and my bill is $100K, I am still left with a $66K bill.

All of his years of wrestling really fucked him up and he was practically running on autopilot for what would have been a while before his murder suicide. We are at a time when we are finally beginning to understand the severity of TBI influence on behavior and suicidal ideation. Check out the ongoing research on NFL players with concussions and their subsequent behavior, and then realize that wrestlers are subject to that much more abuse on an ongoing basis.

With the departure of Graham Arnold imminent and Ange off slaving away as the NT coach, the A-League has lost two of it's big three coaches, with only old Popa left. All three have changed the game in someway in Australia, and it leaves me wondering who is there to step up and help take the league and Aussie football to another next level? I think Rudan will eventually coach a team, and Mulvey (technically English, but considers himself a Brisbane boy) and Edwards are doing good things, but after that I'm stumped. Who, or is anyone else is out there to fill the void? I'm really curious about how this period will shape the A-League."

1,"But as long as the kids are getting good enough grades so the teachers don't get in trouble and the district doesn't lose funding, it's all just fine.","Right? I don't get the point of making it so much harder. Math is a repetition/drill kind of thing for basic stuff. Once you have those basics, you can do anything! I can do a LOT of math in my head and have always loved and understood maths like algebra, geometry and all that. My son's math teacher has informed me that he does not need to know how to do math the way I learned it, that my math education was somehow deficient because it was old-school. Of course, she also informed me that he has no need to learn his multiplication tables because ""we use calculators now."" Are you freaking kidding me? Booting the basics because ""calculators"" is the stupidest thing I have ever heard! You can't do the harder maths if you can't understand the easier ones. I'm not even a teacher and I know this. And we wonder why our students are failing so miserably in comparison to those in other developed nations."

Honestly, success, this season, for me is making the playoffs. Even if we lose in the wildcard round, I would still be happy if we made the playoffs because: A. First year of a regime B. Injuries C. Something to build off of and have momentum for next year. I don't really expect this team to win the Superbowl this year, it just will not happen with this defense.

And your assumption that most moms are married to rich guys and play candy crush, is sadly myopic. While I'm getting my 3 year old in the car, I'm leaving my 5 year old in the house to put on his boots and jacket. I run back to get the 5 year old and he's decided he needs to go to the washroom. Do I wait with the car on the street or in the house with the child? There's the first chance for someone to steal the baby.. Do I deserve the jail time for that? Once I do get them both into the car, one of them will inevitably remember that today is the day they need to bring 'something red' for pre-school. or start screaming because they forgot their stuffed bunny, or my laptop is still by the door, or I get a text from the dayhome reminding me that they need more diapers, whatever. When this is a daily occurrence, its easy to say, ""I'll just run back inside, grab the diapers and we can go."" Now I'm a repeat offender... Are you going to jail me now?

If I see something that makes me feel horny the pressure will intensify a little, but its hardly an issue and it will die down to what its at right now. If my gf starts touching it or whatever then it really starts to intensify and at some point (sorry I can't really say when that point is reached) if she just stopped before I cum then it leads to discomfort for a quite some time. The only time I don't feel that pressure is after orgasm. A few hours after though that low level pressure returns. That's how it is for me anyway."

From time to time we all run up against some super-pros in their video game planes playing their planes correctly. So, I was facing said F-sabre in the MiG. I couldn't do anything to him because he made no tactical mistakes. How is a 15 supposed to beat a well flown F-Sabre if both planes play to their strengths? I can never catch the plane, I can't outturn him if he keeps his speed up, and his zoom climb is incredible. I can't bleed it of energy if he doesn't play my game. Either version has guns that are easier to get on target. The only chance I seem to have is getting some lucky 360noscope pro deflection shot. Is this matchup even balanced? My MiG isn't fully upgraded, but I don't even think it would help much considering what I've seen."

1,They need someone to get Mike into his cage,"What does LSU need to do to return to glory? Competition aside (so no ""move out of the SEC West"" junk), what would you do to right the ship at LSU? Yes, a big part of this season can be blamed on losing a lot of talent to the NFL &amp; a very young team, but clearly there are other things that need fixing at all levels. So what would you do to try &amp; return LSU to the days of being not only competitive in the SEC, but on a national scale again? I have always been a big advocate for Les &amp; I do think that he is a great coach, but I also recognize his stubbornness &amp; ""loyalty to a fault"" nature that goes to anyone who plays or coaches for him. I think he need to re-evaluate that &amp; make some hard changes. On the offensive side of the ball, he needs to let Cam Cameron open it up &amp; take full control of the offense. Les needs to have input &amp; veto power in cases where he wants to pull a Mad Hatter play, but for the most part, let Cam run the offense. Kragthorpe needs to get better at QB development. There was little progression or improvement at the QB position all season. On the defensive side, we need leaders on the field. There was no clear field general. We had guys step up, but no one was the clear leader on the field that the players would look to. Also, if Chavis is heading to A&amp;M, Les needs to make a big hire to replace him. Someone who is already a DC at a big program &amp; possibly someone with HC experience. Defense is essential in the SEC West &amp; we need to not only not miss a beat there, but we need to improve. Recruiting has always been good for LSU, but we need to figure out how to stop bleeding players like Dak Prescott &amp; Landon Collins to Alabama, Texas, Mississippi, etc. The fence around the state needs to get taller, heavier, and more water tight. So what would you change?"

In fact, even in shows where they don't do it to an extreme, like another favorite of mine Neon Genesis Evangelion, *the fans* do the sexualizing for them Have you been to the NGE sub? It's nothing but fan drawn pics of the girls in sexualized positions/clothes.

Early Access is a feature promised in the kickstarter. It's also the only way an Indie dev can bolster their warchest to make a better game, where as a AAA Dev with a publisher behind them can always dip in and get more funds. The DLC on day one is skins, artbook, and soundtrack. Its a way for people who didn't buy digital deluxe to upgrade and get the extra goodies. This isn't charging for extra game features that should have been in the base game, its extra cosmetics you don't have to buy, but can if you want to support the developer. It also isn't gameplay related content. Lastly the always on DRM isn't even DRM. You have to use PA's servers while the game is in development because it's not done. When it IS done, you will NOT have to use their servers. This is completely different than always on DRM. OP is using bullshit comparisons to make EA look not that bad, and make PA look as terrible as EA, when it CLEARLY isn't."

1,The asses who pass on the right really piss me off.,"TIFU BY speeding too slow OK so this actually happened yesterday but close enough ;) back story: so like every weekday I'm driving my normal commute to work Speed limit on the freeway is 65, so i usually travel about 68-69 since cops don't pull you over for going a few MPH over. its a 2/3 lane highway so i usually travel in the left lane (fast lane) since slow trucks are always in the right lane and there isn't much traffic so i cruise control all the way. So I'm cruising along, but this morning I'm tired as fuck. More-so then usual. SO i'm not really driving like one should. I'm just focusing ahead of me and trying to stay awake but I'm doing the whole dose off, drift, hit the lane bumps, wake up straight out thing (aka braille driving) Now on this highway there is a huge hill so uphill i always stay in cruise control since most cars slow down naturally and down hill I'll turn it off and cruise down. So i get to the top of the hill and for some reason i check my rear-view before i decide to take off and accelerate and there is a car up my ass. and i mean up my ass. So much so that I can't see anything but the grill of the car. So in my infinite wisdom I'm like , let me speed up a little as i go down hill to get him off my ass. So I do and go from 68-69 to about 75 MPH and all of a sudden i see the grill in the rearview light up and slow down. It was a f-ing cop car. I see him signal for me to pull over to the right. Now I'm thinking great, gonna be late for work and get a speeding ticket because a cop was riding my ass. Total FML moment. So i Pull over, car in park on the shoulder, roll down windows and prepare for the major ass kissing i'm about to give the cop. I know one thing with cops is you always want to be over-respectful with them. SO pretty much every sentence ends in you calling them sir and agreeing with them. So he comes over to my car and w/o even asking a question (usually cops will ask ""do you know why i pulled you over"" ) he starts giving me a lecture on driving. I'm literally in my head going DAFUQ? but nodding along agreeing. He tells me that the left lane is for passing only and i was driving too slow in it and he wanted to pull the truck over who was in front of me but i was blocking him and passing on the right is dangerous. So yup he tells me that even though i was speeding I was going to slow in the left lane and its a moving violation (aka i can get a ticket for it costing me probably aorund 150 + insurance rates go up) Now at this point I'm literally dumbfounded at whats happening. Of course I don't let it show, I just tell him I wasn't aware and from now on I'll drive in the center or right lane when I'm going. I'm also relieved he didn't catch me swerving while falling asleep lol. So he asks for my license i give it to him and he says he'll be right back. SO I'm like yup fuck getting a ticket for driving too slow while I was speeding. Don't even know hot to comprehend the situation. He comes back hands me my license and lets me go with a warning. Crisis adverted thankfully. Wound up a few mins late for work. No big deal though. TIL you can get a ticket for going to slow when speeding TL;DR: Got pulled over for what i thought was speeding because i was, instead cop tells me i was driving too slow and could get a ticket. lets me off with a warning."

1,Yea blowing up an entire wedding is way more civilized than kidnapping.,"I deplore ""collateral damage"" excuses whether it's gang bangers spraying bullets at each other, or the United States killing ""entire weddings or funerals just to get at one or two people"", but that doesn't refute the claim that ISIL is ""unique in their brutality"". If the United States were kidnapping entire weddings or funerals, and beheading the attendees one at a time to persuade some group to turn over the one or two people we wanted, the United States would be guilty of comparable brutality. As it is, the comparison is warranted, and reminds us we should continue to work on more surgical methods of getting at the one or two people we've targeted, but it only serves to confirm that ISIL is unique in its brutality."

1,Mewtwo wasn't given enough of a chance by sakurai,"Time to defend your main/future main's honor. Unfortunately, when a game comes out and is not available to everyone at once, opinions are made and widely accepted by the gaming community before everyone has a chance to actually play the game themselves. In smash, the rules also apply as it takes only a pro like Zero or M2K to discredit a character before everyone jumps on the bandwagon, and when the game is release worldwide, nobody gives that character a chance. So now is the time, for those of you who have played/observed the game, to defend/destroy the honor of a character you feel doesn't get enough/get's too much credit... What characters do you think haven't been given enough of a chance, or might be better than what some people think? I for one think Little Mac and Bowser Jr are a little underrated. A lot of Little Mac players I've seen aren't playing him like he should be played and I think that's why he gets typecast by those players. Pacman is a character that I believe gets slack for his speed quite a bit, but has such a unique moveset that provides him with a lot of options."

Shit, it has been for quite some time. We aren't, we CAN'T be, the world's police. And now that we're drawing down the size of our military, both in personnel and hardware, continuing the current rate of involvement is entirely untenable. Add to that the number of people who want us to entirely fuck off and let them deal with their own problems, and I would really like to see us scale back much of our overseas meddling. I can't help but wonder...what would the world look like if the US were to actually say, ""Fuck it."" Pull back all foreign bases outside of NATO member nations and countries with whom we have specific, treaty-binding agreements. Reduce the footprint within those countries to a quick-response force only, with plans to rapidly deploy from stateside should something go down. Focus our intelligence agencies on border protection, not internal monitoring and external manipulation, just on protecting the border from direct threats. Build up our defensive military capabilities, stack the coasts with our own ships, and man the skies with our own planes. Offer a helping hand where specifically requested for short timeframes, things like this Ebola issue, but solely humanitarian and in defense of those humanitarian workers, no offensive combat roles in ""policing actions."" Refocus the massive amounts of money and effort we currently spend projecting our penis measurement all over the world into actually developing new technology to HELP the world, not blow it up. Stop funneling billions of dollars of weapons into the hands of who knows which faction, perpetuating the very actions we condemn and eventually meddle with. I don't know what that world would look like, whether it would be better or worse, whether it would even be remotely sustainable, but it's an intriguing idea..."

Take into consideration that this will increase inflation and the cost of living in the city. So the people crying gentrification and the rent being to high etc.. that's only going to continue on an upswing. A living wage is a good way to get votes from people not taking into consideration other factors at play. Take for example if you're a black male who is either unemployed or underemployed. With a rise in the minimum wage, the entry into that remedial labor job becomes more competitive. Now having no HS diploma or work experience puts you back even further. Oh and if you're a teen in HS you can forget about getting a job period. Teen unemployment rate is at a all time high. And unemployment rate among black male and Latinos around 20 -50% depending on whether you live in Public Housing or not."

Alonso in a Red Bull feels very strange to me, I'm not quite sure what it is but it would feel like he'd sold his soul in a way that I wouldn't quite think he had if he moved to McLaren or Mercedes or Lotus or so on and so on.

I was planning on doing an Oatmeal Stout yesterday (sunday). I was even toasting my own flaked barley and flaked oats, to give it a little more roasty/nutty character and give it a personal touch. So I'm roasting my barley, then my oats, while the HLT is heating up and I'm also measuring out all my other grains. Get them all in a bucket and run them to the garage. Timing is working well, but things are moving fast. First, the oats start on fire. (I got impatient and put them on broil towards the end.) That wasn't that bad. I blew them out and threw away the really black stuff, it wasn't much. Disaster averted. So I go to throw them in with the rest of my grains. Let my strike water into the tun, start dumping grains in.... fuck.... i forgot something.... Forgot to fucking mill my grains. I stood there in shock for a moment, thinking of how I should handle this. Of course hindsight is 20/20. I should have realized that my flaked barley/oats were on top, and that's like 75% of what I dumped in. (probably dumped 2 lbs of grains or so) So I should have just milled the rest and continued on, expecting a slightly lower gravity. Of course that's not what I did. I grabbed my strainer and fished the grains out, and threw them in with the rest of the dry grains, thinking if they soak up some moisture, I'll have like 15 lbs or so of moist grains, and I'll mill them and try again. Problem is, I must not have been quick enough and they started to gelatinize. So my mill was not cracking anything, it was just working my drill really hard and caking wet mushy barley to the milling bars... So I got mad, kicked over my bucket, swept it all up, threw it away, and gave up on the day. Such a simple little oversignt totally ruined brewday for me. TL;DR- Didn't mill my grains. No beer for me this weekend."

I've noted growing up that the American left (particularly Democrats) have a hang up with pacifism, to the point of calling for gun control. To my understanding of the left this is actually very contrary to how the left operates. Admittedly violence should be a last option, but being unarmed when your opponent is willing to enslave you is (in my opinion) madness. But why is this so widely despised a concept by the left? I guess from personal experience I see the need to defend yourself, is this just something that isn't widely seen or did I miss a treatise?"

1,You and your pro flat bar agenda!,"If you're considering longer distances for a commute (or just in general), two kinds of bikes to ask about at any of the shops mentioned in this thread would be a _fitness_ bike or a _cyclocross_ bike. A heavier _comfort_ or _hybrid_ bike might also work just fine, especially if you're just starting back on the bike and want to keep your distances low and easy. Since you say that you haven't been on a bike in years, a fitness bike might give you the most bang for your buck. You still get the flat, straight handle bars with an up-right position, with the benefit of a lighter frame, more suited to going faster and longer over flat surfaces. While talking with a salesperson, make sure you mention commuting being one of your primary reasons for purchasing a bike. They can point you to frames that can easily accept lights, racks and fenders - three essential accessories for any bike commuter. And whatever you do, shop around and test ride everything. No shop worth its name will let you go out the door with something that's doesn't fit you properly and doesn't make you feel like a kid again."

Oceans Bitcoin :D Let's make an open-sourced movie script and hope one day a film producer picks it up? Or maybe if we have a producer here we can talk you into making one? **Why a heist/fiction movie**, and not a documentary: * 1 we can educate the public about bitcoin basics, not in depth but just enough to enjoy the heist movie without being in the dark. If you start the movie with a guy fresh out of a 20 year jail sentence, then it's easy to explain the 'why are you explaining this to me' trope because bitcoin is only 5 years old. Bitcoin is the brand new tech, so learning about ways to steal it is an interesting premise (in reality, we're showing how hard it is so steal bitcoins) * 2 we can convey the message that bitcoin has many other security that beats credit cards and cash, etc. during small-talk, without alienating credit cards and cash. * 3 even though it's a heist, it's not a realistic scenario, but it will generate discussion on how to hack a paper wallet (because you can't!) and hopefully get people on board the bitcoin discussion * 4 A tonne of people don't watch documentaries because it's not entertainment value for them. A heist? (bonus if it's a comedy?) hell yeah * 5 at the end of the heist I sorta wanna see some dynamics changing in the bitcoin space - right now we have single addresses with tonnes of bitcoins. After the heist it would be AWESOME to see a paradigm shift, live (well, as live as fiction can be) - and watch those big ones split into tonnes of addresses in smaller units so a future heist won't occur. Great end for a heist movie, great message about Bitcoin, even if it doesn't happen in RL. Thoughts? I have a basic premise in my head I wouldn't mind sharing if we can lock in a producer :)"

All of Nintendo's first and second party developers find the idea interesting and would happily allow you to use their characters. Some third party companies would also allow you to use their characters as well.

They refer to us disparagingly as 'gadje'. Perhaps not ALL of them but a very large number of them subscribe to this attitude which has been a part of Gypsy life for hundreds upon hundreds of years. Perhaps a majority of them don't want to assimilate with non-Gypsies and have zero intentions of settling down or getting a job or paying taxes, i.e. they have no qualms whatsoever with swindling from the gadje and they don't give a shit about them or their country's wellbeing. This attitude might be hard for you to understand, but you're applying your own standards and worldview on that of another group who are quite content with being on the fringes of wider society and have been for a long time. If anyone is racist, it's the Gypsies. The only reason why their racism towards us is considered inconsequential is because most of them are impoverished and politically weak, but that doesn't detract from the fact that they can be a significant burden on local communities and, frankly, their lifestyle should be considered unwelcome."

I have no idea how they manage to reconcile miscarried babies. Mysterious ways, probably. Don't get me wrong, I don't think people should get abortions for fun, but ruling every option out means there are bad situations made worse by lack of flexibility in choices."

The majority of koalas also have chlamydia due to their incessant boning while they're wasted on eucalyptus, and the STD makes them incontinent.

1,It's because the Sultan of Brunei has a sweet collection of cars.,"Part of the reason is that the regions practicing them are in enough of a state of disarray (generally speaking) that Sharia is not the most pressing issue. The Afghan government would rather focus on regaining its rightful territory from terrorist organizations before acknowledging human rights issues in the land they do control. For countries which are more ""organized"", so to speak, such as Saudi Arabia or soon to be Sharia-adherent Brunei Darussalam, they have a value wherein massive quantities of oil are located in a country with a hugely important strategic location. Nobody is willing to threaten the relations with a country like that, even if they've done same to other countries. For example, Obama condemned the law passed by Russia restricting open demonstrations of homosexuality stating that he has no tolerance for countries that do not accept homosexuality, yet Brunei is soon to introduce the death penalty for homosexuality at all, and relations have not changed at all. Celebrities have protested, for example Ellen DeGeneres isn't staying at the Beverly Hills Hotels owned by Hassanal Bolkiah, Sultan of Brunei, but in all honesty, the fact that virtually every country wants to be friends with them means nobody is really going to change anything."

There are many other champions that needs buffs or even NEW kits, tons of them even though I could name only three because I can't be arsed but I'm sure that if you have played the game longer than a year (which I doubt judging by your posts anyway) you would know about.

1,"No you should go fight with your teammates over who gets to take regrab duty, push them out of the way and such.","Blocking vs Chasing Now I'm a chaser. I enjoy chasing. I love popping a fc seeing my enemy's blue/red blood stain the battlefield beneath me. But the following has happened twice now, both times nearly identical (with the same guy involved): I spawn. Both flags are out. Our team's fc is in base, cornered by 2 chasers. Enemy fc is nowhere in sight. I block for our fc. Eventually our flag returns and we score, once winning the game and once tying it up. Both times the fc was the same person. Both times we scored shortly thereafter; both times we won the game, and BOTH times I get the same, very polite text from the scorer. ""Scott. don't block, always chase or try for regrab. Chasing is more important."" Now I'm not terrible, but I'm not great and I want to get better. I genuinely feel like I did the most reasonable thing. No matter how juketastic you are, when 2 competent chasers have you in a corner, there's a good chance you're gonna get popped. Whereas 1 blocker, who's already there, can spend maybe 3 seconds of his time to get you out of that corner and *then* head out to find, chase, corner, and kill the enemy. I don't go out of my way to find someone to block for, but when I see an opportunity to save our team's fc from near-certain death I damn well take it, and I sure as hell expect my teammates to as well. What are your thoughts on momentarily blocking when it is the nearest thing to do? Would any of you block to help the fc when our flag is being held, or is it really always best to ignore your own fc and chase the enemy wherever he is? Am I being an ignorant noob too stubborn to learn from the seasoned veterans, or is ~~this motherfucker~~ ~~Tantrew~~ the other guy ~~just being an ungrateful twat~~ mistaken in his priorities?"

Why shouldn't individual businesses be able to say ""No dogs or Jews allowed"" or require minorities to use a separate entrance and facilities? They can just go someplace else, right? The problem is that some people end up having a lot less freedom. What if the only gas station in 100 miles won't serve you? That means you can't live there. What if most, or all, businesses in an area discriminate against you? That means you can't live there. And being able to charge more to discriminated classes can accomplish the same thing. You can effectively price people out of a given market. This ripples out throughout the economy. Suddenly, employees of a discriminated class are less valuable, so they get hired and promoted less, paid less. They can't travel for business through certain areas, they can't do business with certain companies. Suddenly, discriminated people have limited freedom of movement, because they can't be sure that businesses in a new area (such as a travel destination) will serve them. A business might even serve them today, and not tomorrow. Businesses in some areas could basically compete for bigot dollars by going out of their way to discriminate. The comparative freedom gained by allowing businesses to discriminate is far outpaced by the liberty lost by those who will be discriminated against, in my opinion. These laws were passed for a reason, and we don't need to give those rights away by failing to be vigilant. If the line isn't ""no discrimination in business based on color/creed/gender/etc"", then where do we draw the line, legally speaking?"

Every game, it's void, tinker, doom, lycan, mirana and invoker. It seems like there's very little room for variation. In Dota 1, I could pick an underused carry and have a lot of fun with them. In Dota 2, I'll just get stomped by the death ball unless I comply and pick an equally overpowered hero. There's no room for farming in this version, and there are so many anti carry strategies and items that it's faded as a role, especially in low-mid MMRs where I am currently at. There seems little point to playing carries when the space required to let them farm is more or less from a winning position anyway."

It would add a neat utility to this move. (Help with vision, help slow retreating foes) Spin Web - Rather then manual despawn I just think the web needs to be on a despawn timer.You usually only need them in the area you are working so an increasing up time with a decreasing cool down on use I think would work. Incapacitating Bite - Screw this passive. New move time! Silken Coffin - (Channeled) Broodmother fires a stream of binding silk reducing enemy movement speed but slightly increasing armor as a result. Duration 1/2/3/4 Move Slow 40%/60%/80%/100% Armor Increase 2/4/6/8 Insatiable Hunger - I'd lower the cooldown and increase the buffs. It's an ultimate after all. Make it something that can viably let you nuke down 1 maybe even 2 heroes if you use it wisely. 14 seconds for meager lifesteal/damage increase is not a worthwhile balance. Less up time but more bang for your buck puts it on par with other ults that need to be used wisely in a calculated manner, but have big returns if well timed. Note: I think the new move I suggested would be even cooler if an Ags added the ability to use it on allies. It would serve as a sideways defensive ability, especially if it didn't break channeling.

1,Then they could add body guards so you dont have to shoot either... then you dont even have to be home to play.,"The Future for Grand Theft Auto Games Rockstar should add a bit more realism into their next GTA such as more transportation options. How nice would it be to have your own chauffeur and be able to call him up, be driven in your limo (or really any vehicle) to your personal hangar, and then be dropped right off to your personal jet, which, unless so desired, you also wouldn't have to commandeer. You'd simply tell James which airport you wish to go to and then make your way back to your leather seat and promptly hit the skip button (that's if you don't want to take advantage of the free time and do some things on your phone or just simply want to watch the ride). Then whence arrived at a *different* city, you may perhaps take a bus, subway, or taxi to your next destination. But if it's not your first time doing that and you don't need a skip option because your destination isn't far, you'll probably just run in front of a car and then promptly jack it. (: There is one thing though that I'd like to see patched into the current GTA5, and that's the ability to call in your own, bought helicopter like you do with your mechanic for your car or Merryweather for a helicopter pick up.

I'm not gonna say we were really good friends but we smoked together a couple times (not sure if that means anything) so I said sure and that I would be taking the bus over there. I got ready and told my dad I would be leaving. I lost my house key a while ago so I had to let him know. I locked the door and began walking to the bus stop. It was about a five minute walk from the house. When I walk alone I try my best not to make eye contact with anyone. It's just weird to me. I passed by a liquor store and saw a man leaning by a red truck. He looked to be about in his fifties. He was a short man, probably about my height and was a bit on the heavier side. Judging by the liquor store and the area I was in, he was probably Mexican (or Latino?). I made eye contact with him. Damn it -.- He smiled and said hello. The people in my neighborhood are nice so I smiled back at him. I was to scared to say anything back because that's just me in these types of situations. He asked if I needed a ride to which I just smiled and shook my head. I made my way to the corner to cross the street. The signals felt like they were taking forever. I saw him move to the other side of his truck. I could hear him calling me. ""Baby, you need a ride? Baby. Baby."" He kept calling me that and staring at me with that look I know too well. I was feeling really uncomfortable and just kept looking straight waiting for the walking signal to show up and get me the hell out of there. I felt my phone vibrate so I checked and it was my friend. Apparently he had to work on something for class and couldn't make it. I was more upset that I had to walk back to my house I was now locked out of. I turned around and made my way back only to hear that dreaded word again followed by that damn question, ""You need a ride?"" Was that the only thing this creep could say? I looked at him very sternly, still walking, and said no. Just straight up no. I continued walking and only thought about how annoyed I was. I turned around the corner and walked for about a minute until I saw a car coming this way. Not a car, but a truck. A red truck. And there he was. He slowed down and repeated his question yet again. ""Baby, you need a ride?"" I was so pissed off. I turned around and yelled, ""Dude, fuck off!"" I continued walking home and he drove off only for me to see him driving down my street. At that second I wanted to just grab a flamingo off of a neighbors lawn and smash it through his window. But he kept driving. He didn't notice me and he turned his red truck in the other direction. I felt so relieved but I still ran the rest of the way home just in case to get there before he decided to drive through again. Once I got home, I sat on the porch for a few minutes and strategically hid behind the plants lined on the fence. Luckily another friend asked if I wanted to go to the mall. She came by to pick me up and during that waiting time I watched the streets praying he didn't come through and notice me. Thankfully he didn't. I'll just never forget how much his question angered me."

While a lot of redditors / Americans love to hate him, simply being the first black president is pretty historic achievement.

A succesful team that won worlds, but else just practices all day and does not make serious, funny or sad vlogs etc, is not a team to be a fan of. You can respect them sure, but you wont ever know a personal thing about their life as you will with EU and NA teams. Sure they might not be the best. But i atleast i know the team i care about."

1,"99% are sluts, don't fool yourself","An Honest Discussion on Good Girls I'm not a newb to trp, but not a pro either. With that in mind, I've met a number of girls throughout the years. While I would say about 65 to 70 % fit the typical trp slut definition (solipsism, hypergamy, etc...) I would say though that about 5 to 10 % percent were actually good girls. Traits I use to define a Good Girl include: Very low partner count out of choice, somewhat averse to clubbing/partying, do not need to post 'spicy' pics for approval/validation, caring and not self centered etc... basically wife material. Some of these girls I am really good friends with for a number of years so I know for a fact good girls exist. The remaining percentage are girls that can be molded into GGs. I personally believe that while many sluts are naturals, some are made. Good girls that got their heart broken by some guy spinning his plates irresponsibly or some related reason. Part of the reason why I think trp focuses so heavily on sluts is for several reasons. **Selection bias** (many here are picking these girls up at clubs/raves/bars), as well as **self fulfilling prophecies**. I've found that women are not bad at guessing when a guy just wants casual sex vs one that is more relationship oriented. Sluts and GGs are usually attracted to diff types (not always of course). What do you guys think? Note: many trp blogs also agree w me. You will usually find in articles dedicated to the fem psych aspect to at the end something along the lines ""don't take this too literally as there are quality women out there""."

1,"Ah, but reddit feminists tell me things like this *never happen* so I'm going to have to call bullshit on this, OP.","Not a divorce attorney but I clerked for a judge that handled divorce cases. We had a couple that were both lieutenant colonels in the Air Force. They had one daughter that was about 11 or 12. Both had graduate degrees and were generally intelligent people. Well the husband had an affair and things went sour with the relationship. The daughter was at that age when her relationship with the mother was starting to get a little strained and she mentioned how she wanted to stick with her dad because he was about to be stationed elsewhere and the parents would be going their separate ways. The mother absolutely freaked. The first thing she did was go to the local police department and claim the father had been molesting and raping the daughter. They investigated and couldn't find any evidence so they dropped the case. The mother still furious then goes to the Air Force Office of Special Investigations and reports the same thing. The Air Force then suspends the husband from duty and conducts their own investigation, same result no evidence of wrong doing and the case is dropped. The mother then goes to the next state over where the husband is about to be transferred and contacts the local police there with the same story about molestation and rape. They of course do their own investigation but same result, case is dropped Of course this whole time the daughter has been interviewed a dozen times by psychologists, various therapists, the police, the Air Force, and who knows else. The daughter is straight up traumatized by this. People constantly asking her if her dad had been touching her/raping her and so forth. Not to mention the harm it did to her father's career. He was basically screwed from any possible promotion just because of the allegations. As well as the fact that infidelity in the military is a big no no. But that was his own doing. Well once word of all this gets back to the judge he is furious. He's a former Air Force Jag and still has contacts in the ranks. Well anyway the couple comes in front of him one day for a hearing and he outright tells her she better stop this behavior or he's going to hold her in contempt of court for the maximum amount of time he can lawfully hold her in a cell, contact the DA and recommend the filing of charges, contact her Air Force superiors and recommend reprimand to the fullest extent possible, and basically anything and everything he can do within his power. It was one of the most messed up things I've seen during my relatively short experience in the legal world."

1,Hobby Lobby should keep their ~~slaves~~ workers in cages to monitor their religiousness at all times.,"Help me out here...

The argument being put forth by their lawyer (heard it this morning on NPR) is that the employees are free to buy contraceptives on their own, but it would be wrong to ""force"" the company to provide contraceptive coverage as part of their health plan. Well if the employees go out and take the money they earned from working at Hobby Lobby to buy contraceptives or even pay for an abortion, isn't that the same thing? Health insurance is part of the compensation earned by employees. So if Hobby Lobby pays X amount of dollars per month for a health plan which provides contraceptives, or the employee spends X amount of their wages on the same product...what's the difference? Either way Hobby Lobby's money is going to pay for something contrary to the religious beliefs of the owners."

She later (2-3 years) hooked up with my father instead, they were married for about a year before they divorced, she's also the mother of my half-sister (who is named after Ann Nicole Smith)."

After about 15 minutes of playing with it, Anna's torso fell apart. So we returned it again. This time, we didn't get a new one. Then she got a Disney Princess castle for Christmas. It's essentially a big plastic dollhouse. The pieces don't fit together perfectly, and parts of it are warped. My daughter was happy with it as is, so I let it be. I'm kind of annoyed though, because these are two Disney products that have been shoddily made.

1,*but those characters are for SEX APPEAL*,"The guy with the Anonymous mask is a dick head. As for the discussion it is one that needs to be made. It would be nice to see more female characters in games however they neglect to realise that most of the people playing these games are male. Yes. Female gamers exist but here's the thing: they like what is currently produced. Hence they buy the things. Would they prefer there to be more female characters? Probably but it's clearly not a deal breaker. It's created something of a problem in the game industry. There is an assumption that guys won't play games with female leads despite successes (Mirror's Edge, Tomb Raider) merely because the top sellers have male protagonists. They have no incentive to make a change to this for the moment. The males sell therefore females might not. Would it be nice to have more varied stories? Hell yeah it would but not every game needs it. I play JRPGs and they have a good assortment of male and female characters with a decently crafted story. I play a military shooter? There's not going to be many females in it since there are fewer in the military and the story is just going to be shoot shoot, bang bang. The problem the games industry has currently is a lack of variety in story. Not a distinct sexism."

1,"I'm sure eallen has the billions of capital to invest in production facilities, it's just that those greedy corporations won't let him at the gas.","There are a lot of things that make business sense that may not fit the image of a perfect society. In the aggregate, if you force every single person and entity to start doing unprofitable things for the greater good (as you define it btw), we end up causing massive distortions in the market. So tax breaks reduce flaring? Why not increase tax breaks for drilling in general then, so we can get even more gas? Tax breaks for finding gas, tax breaks for not flaring it, tax breaks for building the pipelines to transport it, and tax breaks for people who use it. That makes it a very valuable resource all of a sudden. But who should pay for this? And what massive distortions would it cause? You may say that I took the point too far, but when dealing with something that is unprofitable to produce you have to massively incentivize it to be produced. There is more than one operator in the Bakken (so don;t paint with a broad brush as to their reasons), and I guarantee that the infrastructure in North Dakota was poor at best before this began. So it may be a logistical issue in that they don't have the infrastructure, but they cannot build the infrastructure because of money. Believe it or not."

1,"SCH had the best AF quest out of all of them, I mean seriously... you went shopping... for clothes... it was soooooo awwwwwesome.","It seems my opinion counters most of what is commented here, but here's what I feel: Class quests: I mean really, it's hard to compete with ACN and GLD. ROG looks nifty but I haven't completed the level 30 capstone quest(s). Job quests: PLD was boring until the level 45 quest, which I totally did not see coming. Continued to be boring after that. WAR was fascinating to watch, if not predictable. Though I did conceive of a lot of different ways that questline could end. WHM was boring and dumb. SCH sucked until the level 50 quest, which was amazing. On the other hand, the SMN quests were really cool up until the level 50 quest, which felt too bogged down by lore we didn't yet understand as players to be interesting. Major candidate for continuation of plot. BLM questline... this is a largely personal opinion (as is all of this), but it just felt really contrived to me. Not to mention that after playing XI for ten years I had a very hard time getting over the fact that they were pushing forward a very serious plotline with dire consequences with the central object being the ""Gem of Shatotto"". Hard to swallow for me. MNK questline had the best lore and dialogue, no questions. Points for being an unorthodox take on a very commonly used fantasy role, and I enjoyed how organic both the characters were. DRG questline was extremely hard to follow, and the ending felt extremely artificial and without any sort of explanation at ALL. Did not like it one bit... though my expectations might have been set a little high by the job/artifact armor questline from XI, which was hands down one of the best questlines of any MMO I have played. And BRD was dumb and super predictable. Can't comment on NIN yet, haven't hit 30.

1,You are just not believing strong enough!,"I've heard this before and I don't really find it all that helpful. Here's why: Suppose I go to bed tonight, I tell myself it's easy, and I tell myself I'll have a lucid dream. I go to bed, have a dream, and nothing. No lucidity. The next night I try it again. Then again the next night, and again, and again. Nothing, every time. Finally, we get to the point that I don't believe it anymore; why would I, when night after night, it didn't work? The way it's described makes it sound so simple and effortless, but it's never turned out that way to me. When I read advice like this, I feel like it doesn't really help me figure out what I did wrong and what I have to do different to succeed. If just believing is enough, why didn't it work the first week I did that? I dunno if I didn't believe it hard enough, but I can't force myself to believe more than I did that first time, especially when every time, I had no success and therefore actually have more reason to believe it's *not* true. I can't believe in something that my personal experience tells me doesn't work. It also doesn't really help to me to hear people who've had dozens or hundreds of lucid dreams talk about how easy it is. Of course it's easy for you; you've already mastered it! For someone in my position, it feels off-putting if anything, because it contradicts all the times I've tried and failed to do it, despite telling myself how easy it is and how successful I'll be the whole way. Does anyone get where I'm coming from? Is there some part of this I'm not understanding? tl;dr believing it's easy is actually pretty difficult when you've had failure after failure."

Get reprimanded if you don't answer your phone at 2am (Or 6pm at dinner with the family) and there's some minor emergency. Work 12-18+ hours shifts, my record is 32 and did a number of 24hr shifts. Since its salary, you get no benefit to it and the company could give no fucks. Your life becomes meaningless. You don't have fun, or hang out, or have hobbies. You work. You make sure people have enough fritos and soda to buy. Repeat day after day after day. The last holiday I had off was Christmas 2012, and that was the only holiday I had off that year. 2. Everyone hates you. You're employees hate you if you don't coddle them, give them additional breaks or hold their hand through their shift. Your bosses hate you, because you could always be doing more and god forbid they find out that you cut a 10 minute corner in an 85-95hr workweek. Customers hate you because their credit cards dont work, because they crashed into something on the property, because the manufacturer is out of stock, because they left their wallet and money somewhere and expect you to pay it out of your own pocket 3. The pay sucks, and there is little to no room for advancement. Many retail managers are on welfare unless they're in a big store as a general manager (stores typically bigger than you'd think). However most make just barely over the income limit for welfare and can't apply. No opportunity for a 2nd job since you have no personal time and would be expected to be called in to work 24/7/365. Same goes for additional education. To me this is depressing and noone I know has anything that comes close. You make shit pay, work shit hours you hear people committing suicide over, and everyone hates you or yells at you all fucking day. Get a day off a month and the company says ""I don't know what you're complaining about"""

Most people on this board are probably 10 years into Baltimore at max and don't remember just how fucking shitty the 90s were, but let me put it to you this way. Do you know those $400,000 rowhomes they're fixing up about a block off the square? I could have bought those homes for $20,000 fifteen years ago and the seller would have thrown in a blowjob for taking the property off their hands. Property on the square? Those businesses were going for $30,000 max and now they rent for about that each year. I remember running the waterfront path from the inner harbor out to Canton in the early 2000s (it was scarey!!) and asking the builders how much one of those homes were going for on the pier off of Boston St. He told me $300,000 and I told him he could go fuck himself for that money. They now cost $1 million each. I'm not minimizing the incident. Every violent act is a tragedy, and this is no different. I hope they get these kids, it was a senseless act. Just keep in mind where you're coming from and don't get carried away if Canton's not fucking heaven yet, because 20 years ago it was almost hell."

1,Soooo... Your boyfriend is the one with problems?,"I hit my boyfriend this morning and it has changed my view on the men's rights movement. This morning I did something horrible. I resorted to violence out of anger instead of just walking away and dropping the issue. Without getting into too many details, my boyfriend suffers from major depression and every now and then he takes it out on me. He wanted to be alone last night so made me sleep on the couch (it's his apartment). He seemed mostly ok this morning, but I pressured him for an apology, which I didn't get. Instead of dropping it or just walking away to cool off, I snapped. I was tired of him not listening and refusing to talk, so I grabbed his phone and threw it against the wall. He told me to leave, so then I hit him in his face several times. He restrained me, and when he let go I tore up his kitchen by throwing things and shattered his coffee pot. On the way home I called him and apologized and he accepted. I feel terrible about myself. I have NEVER resorted to violence before in my life. I also thanked him for not retaliating. The thing is, I know that if he would have hit me he'd be in jail right now. If he had called the cops on me I don't know what the penalty would have been... I probably would have been charged, but the stigma wouldn't be anywhere near as bad as it would have been for him or any other guy. I always hated the men's rights movement and thought it was a joke, but looking in the mirror right now I am disgusted with myself."

1,"Yeah, I'm so sick of you commission only salespeople trying to downsell me stuff.","Entitled idiots want free home improvements (long). I've mentioned my job here and my interactions with parents. Most of the time it's honestly no big deal. Every so often, I run into a monumentally bad parent or a kid that just won't fucking listen. This is going to be a long entry... I went to a person's home to sell them flooring. I parked outside and could smell that mildew smell that is present when you're near a swamp. I entered the house and was greeted by the parents and three kids. I could still smell that smell in the air. There was no flooring in the home, just the cement subfloor. There was some heavy rain, and when that happens, explained the home owner, the house floods. There was a really bad storm and the house completely flooded and ruined their floors. I ask how long they've lived there and the answer is less than five years. Their kids are youngest of three. This was a four bedroom, one story house with both a living room and den. Not a small house. There were huge LCD televisions in the living room and den (like 60 inch or bigger), surround sound in the den, a PS4 and Xboxone, as well as tvs no smaller than 40 inches in all bedrooms and video games and the fourth bedroom was the office with a multi monitor battle station and two laptops. There were at least three tablet computers in the home. I asked my standard questions which included the question about insurance (only ask in cases of water damage). He said ""I can't afford insurance."" I was visibly stunned by that answer. So, I take my measurements, while having to fight off the kids. Just love it when parents think that letting their kids follow me around, constantly asking me questions is a good thing. I measure everything, figure out the square footage per room and closet as well as total square footage for the entire home and ask ""What kind of flooring do you want?"" Both the parents answered hardwood floors. Hardwood is the most expensive flooring we carry. I point out the benefits of laminate flooring with kids versus the downside of hardwood flooring and kids. I get the answer of ""I don't want that cheap looking shit."" To each their own. After all I'm not paying for it and it's not my home. They pick out what hardwood they want and I give them a quote of over $15,000. This is flooring, installation, taxes and everything else. The father says ""That's the cost of a new car."" I go back to installation as well as they picked the most expensive product we carry. Not to mention the quality of work and materials. He says, upset, that we should do it all for free because of his kids. That his kids are living in a house without real floors and how dare we charge him for new flooring. At this point he has told me that he can't afford insurance but the six televisions, no smaller than 40 inches. Brand new computers, tablets and video games are affordable. He moved into this home when he still had two children, in a house that had a fucking swamp in the back yard, I can still smell the mildew inside the home. They knew it was prone to flooding, STILL did not get insurance and had a third kid. Then...THEN, he insists on the expensive flooring because the laminate looks cheap. Now, this son of a bitch wants it all done for free because he has young kids. He then bitches at me for being a commission only salesman who's looking to scam him on a job. Yeah, how dare I want to get paid for driving out to your home, measure the entire place and convince you to do business with the company I represent. I'm not scamming anyone, this asshole just thinks that because he owns a house and has children that he's fucking entitled the best we have for free. I ask him ""When you need car work done, do you demand that the mechanic does it all for free because you have children?"" He says ""You're a huge nationwide company, you can afford to do this for me for free."" I sit there, think about this for a moment and start to pack up my stuff. ""No. No we can not afford to do this much work for free. The company is not going to donate flooring to you because you don't want to pay for it. Our installers aren't going to work for free because you put entertainment and toys over properly taking care of your home. You want it done for free, go to a church and beg them to make you their charity case. We're a business and you're wasting my time."""

1,How about a mode where some NPC - lets call him John Spoonfeeder for now - just gives you all the items you want?,"GRift Reward: Legendary Items Ive thought about this since 1 day after 2.1 came out; quite simple but will never happen..too much coding When Urshi spawns you have an option of Keystone/Gem upgrade or 'Legendary Item' When you choose 'item' categories appear like Kadalas list however (and this needs debating) you get a choice of a Legendary item in particular and then the Grift lvl determines the % chance to get it. It could be completely random per type ie random Wand or say Wand of Woh, and it works like this for example: I Beat Grift 35 on a geared class and im wanting a Wand of Woh and currently im just getting shards to Kadala but I really am targetting a Woh: Rift 35 - Could give me a 12% chance to find a Woh out of the 'Wand' catgegory. I pick WoW and 'You fail to obtain the legendary!' Next I try Grift 36 - Wand of Woh this time has a 14% drop chance from Urshi - I fail Next I try Grift 37 - Wand of Woh this time has a 16% drop chance from Urshi - fail etc This could be a nice way to 'eventually' obtain certain items I have never EVER seen and I want (not Wand of Woh) or It could be a guaranteed random leg drops you choose ie random 'wand'"

Removing Talon's silence makes a lot of sense since Adc's need to have a chance to counter play against his burst but the main reason I liked his silence was to stop Katarina's ultimate. Can we still have Talon interrupt channeled abilites just like the change to Kassadin's silence?

I've been invited to events, only to be asked not to bring my girlfriend, I've had women come up to me in bars and ask why my girlfriend is fat....complete strangers....really felt the need to ask me this. It hasn't been just a few ribbings here or there. I've always liked fat women so since middle school until now as a 28 year old man I'm still getting crap for it. I went through phases where people made me feel ashamed and I got over that quick, but there's always this thing in the back of my mind where I wish I didn't have to feel bad for liking what I want. And I know I only feel that way because I've been reprimanded for it so much. If no one ever said anything how would I have developed the consciousness ya know? My life is great and I've always been happy with my the women I've been with, but it's always someone else chiming in and I never understood why they have to say stuff to my face. It's hard to not care what people think and I know it shouldn't matter but, if you're one of these people, try your best to realize there is too much variation and complexity on this earth and in our species for everyone to chase after ""hot chicks"". I mean logically why would guys want that anyway? For every guy that likes fat women, that's less competition for your hot chicks lol."

1,"Don't you mean ""well pleased""?","The LDS Church teaches you to be prideful. **TL;DR:** The way the Church treats leadership teaches members to be proud when they receive leadership callings. ------ Someone on the lds sub basically called me a prideful coward because I don't want to tell my bishop about all my doubts and concerns with the church. (I've chosen to keep my calling as an EQP, and I don't feel like talking to the bishop about how I think the BOM is a non-literal story/parable). Within the Church, everyone talks about how important it is to be humble and beware of pride. In that context, most people mean that we shouldn't assume we know better than God or the leaders he calls. But the Church also teaches you that some people are given ""keys"" to revelation. When I was called as an EQP, I was still pretty TBM, and I felt proud that I was selected to get these special keys. I felt proud that I got to spend time with the Stake President and hear him tell me I was awesome (I wasn't). I felt proud when I got to sit in on ward council, or give announcements on Sunday. I felt proud when I could use my ""keys"" to make a decision about home teaching or call a teacher. I didn't feel like I was getting spiritual promptings, specifically, but I felt like it was possible these keys unlocked something in my mind or soul that allowed me to have more wisdom. And then I pretended I wasn't proud. Missionaries who are called to be APs or Zone Leaders try not to act proud, but they tell everyone about it and even put it on their resume sometimes. When it comes up in church that a guy was an AP, the bishop immediately thinks the guy is awesome. The church teaches you not to speak ill of the Bishop, and that you should have a higher level of respect for what the Stake President says than your neighbor. The church teaches you to make extra preparations and pray with gratitude whenever one of the Apostles or other general authorities visits your ward. Oh, and the Church seems to only call very successful men with high-end educations to be in top leadership positions. Very few poor or uneducated men become bishop in the US these days. Now, I'm at the point where I realize that I suck at being a good christian, and that's actually making me a better EQP. I'm finally in a place where I relate to most of my quorum, and I actually want to learn more about them. I don't want to give up my calling yet, because I think I might actually be able to make a difference. And if I told the Bishop or Stake President the truth, I'm almost certain I'd be released."

One woman's tagline was ""Proven business leader and mom who will fight for blah blah.."" WHY DO I CARE IF YOU HAVE KIDS? How does that affect your ability to perform your duties in office AT ALL? Ugh."

1,Jimmy Graham was a basketball player.,"What's something people would only know about your favorite NFL team if they watched all their games? Giants fan. Eli throws a lot of bogus interceptions. He throws about 4 or 5 a year that come at the end of the first half or at the end of the game where he just throws the ball up there because it doesn't matter, and somehow this always ends up being an interception rather than a touchdown. (except for that one time it worked against the Packers in that playoff game a few years ago) Also, Eli has thrown more unlucky interceptions from balls bouncing off of his own receivers than any other quarterback I've ever seen. You know that pass to Rueben Randle in the end zone that was was in his hands for a touchdown, but then bounced back and ended up being an interception? That's like 1/3rd of Eli's interceptions. In short, Eli doesn't suck nearly as much as you think he would if you just look at his stats and see how many interceptions he has. --- So, what's something people might not know about your team unless they watched all the games?"

1,TIL that CS:GO is open-world,"I think it's close to this. GTA4 and GTA5 are huge, beautifully rendered, open worlds that offer virtually no reason whatsoever to interact with them. Outside of the story missions, there's very little *of consequence* to do. Throw darts? Whee. GTA5 did have businesses, but they were executed very poorly, with such a dramatic economic scale that they had either no effect on gameplay or too drastic an effect. Contrast that with Vice City, where businesses and equipment kinda had similar prices, so the economy sort of worked. And contrast 4 and 5 with Red Dead Redemption, where there was always something *of consequence* happening, or something to do. Hunting? Sure, hunt anywhere, for money, and unlock new equipment as a result, or accessories, or locations, or maps, or treasures, or whatever. GTA5 had a hunting minigame in one corner of the map that had nothing to do with anything else. I don't even recall a reward for it, just a few more bucks when one of the early missions gives you like $3,000,000. The world simply held nothing of any value to the user. People are paying hundreds of dollars in CS:GO for completely pointless weapon skins, but they're doing it because the skins offer a sense of achievement and consequence. GTA5 has nothing even on that level. Skyrim, of course, does. In spades. So I think that's what it comes down to. Not just that the world exists and is active, but that there are positive consequences to interacting with it. Fallout 3's another perfect example of that. If you glimpsed a toilet in the middle of a desert in Fallout 3, you'd walk over to it and investigate it. Why? Because there was nothing in Fallout 3 that didn't in some way reward interaction. Every little scene told a story, or offered an interesting reward, or a new experience, or whatever. Everything was worth interacting with."

1,But I want to hear about how great my trade deals would be if they ever happened!,"Gain a little perspective when posting proposed trades in the trade threads If you are the one proposing the trade, post the trade as if you're the manager receiving the proposition. I know it's nice to see if you're getting the better end of the deal but if you post as the receiving team, then you're likely to find out if the trade will even be accepted based on the responses. For example: ""Give: Green Get: Bradshaw I have: Brown, Watkins, Morris, Martin He has: Benjamin, J Jones, Oliver, Bush"" * If posted this way you're going to receive a bunch of responses like ""Yeah man do that, you really need a RB and you still have Brown and Watkins."" However if you were to post as the person receiving the trade: ""Give: Bradshaw Get: Green I have: Benjamin, J Jones, Oliver, Bush He has: Brown, Watkins, Morris, Martin"" * You're going to get responses like ""No way man, you need to hold onto Bradshaw because of your weak RB. Besides you still have Jones and Benjamin."" Posting this way can help you structure your trades so they're more likely to be accepted. Sometimes all it takes is the opinion of another person to add one player over the other to help get a trade accepted."

1,Yeah Peke played terrible at wolrds,"I think the big difference is the fact that NA has built a real national league, while the EU can never ever have that because it's so many countries where players come from. This matters in the long run, it keeps away fresh players (in Korea you see new names on every position and players from solo-qeue subbing in regularly) and kind of narrows the perspective of legit playtime in the 'big' LCS. A teen would have to move to Germany, away from home country etc., this is something different them moving to another state into the TSM house who everyone has seen a thousand times on YouTube and in a team that's way more socially accessable, also Riot HQ is way more involved. It shows in the fact that NA is constantly shuffeling, and in Europe it has been 20 players at the top for a couple years. Lemondoges was supposed to be our break iron but they got destroyed by money.

1,Everything!,"What do I need to know to be a GM? Hey, this is my first time posting in this sub, just found it last night when I remembered there's literally a subreddit for most of everything. I started playing Pathfinder about a year ago when I saw a poster on my college campus advertising an interest meeting to start some groups going. I'd never played any tabletop or pen and paper RPG's before then, but I was hooked after the first session. I've been in about 3 campaigns now, counting the one I'm in which is currently ongoing with the same group that I met a year ago. Two of the group are experienced as GMs and tend to be players in each other's campaigns when they run at the same time. While we tend to not complete the stories of our campaigns due to university schedules, I'm no stranger to 6 or 7 hour sessions with tons of roleplay and combat. I've watched the people I've come to call friends as they run their stories and I have a growing desire to do some of that myself. Playing a PC is pretty fun, but I tend to have terrible luck with the dice. In fact, my bad luck is so legendary with the group at this point that my characters are expected to fail more often than not. I actually enjoy that, adds some danger to the game. In fact I have a few tales that could be pretty amusing, but I digress. So, as a player I've mostly just been using my dice, some printed character sheets, and the Pathfinder SRD website. My goal is to have a campaign designed and ready to go by the spring, so I can hopefully talk my friends into playing through it with me as the GM. I don't really know what I need besides what I already have though. I know miniatures and a grid mat would be helpful, and I'd have access to some of those in the form of borrowing them from my friends. I've already set aside a binder full of college ruled and graph paper, but what else would I need?"

1,Peeing in a pool sure is pro.,"Wading Pool Sabatoge (or: Attack of the 'Gentiles'!) Growing up, our yard backed up to the back yard of the neighbors behind us, with a gate. They were a Mormon family with 5 kids around our ages, and we were 'somewhat' friends with them so were always playing back and forth in each other's yards. One day, one of the girls invited my sister and I over to play, and to show off the new ""swimming pool"" her father had bought for them (it was one of those high sided hard plastic wading pools), and invited us to jump in. This continued for a couple days. Coming over to play as usual a few days later, the kids told us that their father had told us we weren't allowed to play in the water, because (I swear I am not making this up) we were ""gentiles"" and therefore would ""pollute"" the water. My sister was about 8 years old, and I was about 6 at the time. We may have been young, but we knew enough to be really upset and hurt. And, once it was explained to us by our parents just *exactly* he meant by that, we were angry. Really angry. A bit after this (maybe a week or two), we overheard the mother telling our mom that they would be gone for a week to go camping, and if she would keep an eye on the house (yep, too filthy to wade in a kiddie pool, but a great resource when they wanted something!). A plot of revenge was planned between my sister and I. Waiting until the day after they'd left, we spent the morning drinking lemonade. Copious amounts of lemonade. And then we waddled across the yards to their unsullied pool and proceeded to drain about two gallons of pee into the water. On the way back we also raided their large garden, filling up on anything ripe enough to eat. I cannot express the sense of satisfaction on hearing them gleefully splashing away the day they returned (and the next day, and the next), unwittingly baptizing themselves in the bodily fluids of their dirty, atheist neighbors. Bonus: We overheard the mom complaining to our mom about how they were having to buy chicken wire for the garden to keep the animals out because they had lost so many vegetables! A summer my sister and I will remember fondly for the rest of our lives."

In a story about a flower shop starting to accept Bitcoin; they tell viewers to look to get into Bitcoin. There were no warnings or any extra infromation at all. They just said Bitcoin is better for consumers and businesses because the transaction doesn't go through a bank. This seems hugely irresponsible to me. If you know what you're getting into, and you know the risks and understand the tech, then by all means speculate on Bitcoin. But to tell your average local news viewer to go but their money into Bitcoin, without going into any of the possible risks, seems downright ignorant. I mean there's been plenty of posts here on reddit where people have their whole wallets stolen by bots that guess common keys (or however it works... I've read a fair bit about it and still don't totally understand). In my mind, this is even more risky then KSDK telling their viewers to put their money in high-risk stocks... which is something they'd never do... they would advise mutual funds or something. So what is the difference with Bitcoin? Is it really a case of them literally having no idea what they're reporting on? (Just because I can't imagine it's purposefully malicious, nor do I think they have any personal gain in advocating for Bitcoin)."

The XP-50 is fantastic at climbing, and those dual 20mms can wipe out one fighter (60 rpg isn't enough to take out two unless you place your shots really well), plus it has tons of ammo for it's 50s and since 50s are fantastic at setting stuff on fire it does fairly well. It also is fantastic when it comes to turning, only really being bested by spittys and japanese fighters. I really do not understand why it gets so much hate around these parts. And lets be honest here, the XP-55 looks cool as fuck."

1,"But muh EG is down to the lower bracket after a good place, how can that be fair","Let's at least let the event finish before we complain about the format. I have seen a lot of complaining about the format for this year's International, as I'm sure all of you have (especially considering the huge post on the front page right now). While I don't want to straight up say that the things that people are complaining about aren't valid, I think that it's way too soon to start trashing this competition based solely off of the CONCEPT of its format. Some things I think are worth noting: -The maximum number of games the TI3 main event format allowed was 40. TI4 allows for 32. -The lower bracket is BO3. Last year many people were sad that their favorite teams lost a BO1 and were out of the main event just like that. -All of the teams here battled hard for their spot, even more so than last year Of course the big argument comes from knowing a team that's in the grand finals after just one day of the main event. So what? It doesn't discount all of the other games that will be played. How does it take away from ""hype""? Did everyone already forget what happened last year? Alliance steamrolled their way into the grand finals, dropping only 1 game to DK. The best games from last year's International came from the lower brackets and the grand finals (with a couple of exceptions). The first set of upper bracket games were TERRIBLE last year, very boring in my opinion and quite one-sided. I won't make comments about how they were this year, other than that I felt they were way better. The big point that I want to get to is that everyone should just calm down and watch the damn event. It's been one day, and there are three left. Three days of potentially amazing games that could be the best games of Dota that you've ever watched. Three days of emotional storylines; who will make it further, C9 or Navi; will DK rise up from the lower bracket and claim the championship that many thought they would; or will EG take it home for NA? None of these things are known. Just as last year, we have no idea what happens next other than that Newbee is in the grand finals. And so what? We don't know the second team in the grand finals. We don't know how the games leading up to and including the grand finals will end. All we know is that one group of 5 players is going to play against another group of 5 players for $5mil. We knew that before this event even started. The vocal majority can whine and whine all they want about the format and how it's not as ""hype"" this year but when the grand finals end on Monday and this sub is flooded with threads about how amazing the event was, I hope the people bitching so much now can look back and see that they judged this way too early. We're watching people play Dota in a fucking stadium, we can watch this shit on ESPN. We're watching people from all around the world play for a grand prize of $5mil. I think that's pretty amazing."
1,"I'll go tell this to the dietitian i've had my whole life, sounds like she needs to know this.","You used more calories when growing quickly, because the extra calories were being converted into bone, muscle, skin etc. When you were overweight, you were eating more calories than you needed for your energy output at the time. So it's likely that the diet which wasn't suitable for you as a short (and therefore fat) kid, was actually a correct calorie input for someone who is larger, and therefore uses more calories.

1,But I thought this was all the fault of the homosexuals,"I happened to see a news report from July 16th 1989 earlier today with a report on a miner strike in Soviet Union. The miners were striking because the working conditions and payment were unbearable. They were mining coal all day long but the coal was piling up outside because they couldn't provide enough cargo trains to transport the coal from the mines. In the end, the coal heaps were so big that they started to self-incinerate while at the same time people in the cities were freezing during winter 1989 because they had no coal. The miners were also demanding to finally get enough to eat at the canteens at work and at least 500 grams of soap per month so that they could wash themselves properly. There are many more examples like these that show how run down the Soviet Union was in its final days. It was a failed system because five-year plans never really worked out. You can't predict the course of the economy in the future."

1,seems legit,"It is apparently a common misconception. In the translation notes for Chistopher S. Mackay's translation of The Hammer of Witches, he states this: ""Nigromancer, nigromancy This is the medieval form for the Greek term necromancy, which literally signifies ""corpse divination,"" a compound noun whose first element derives from the noun necros (""corpse""). Once knowledge of Greek was lost in Western Europe in the early medieval period, this element was confused with the Latin *niger* (""black""). Since the color black was associated with evil because of the blackness of night-time darkness, the use of the color to describe what was taken to be the evil practices of magic and witchcraft would have been perfectly natural, and the skills by which magic was practiced came to be known as the ""black arts."" Given these associations with black arts inherent in the form ""nigromancy,"" I have decided to retain the medieval version rather than adapt it to the modern ""necromancy,"" which was different connotations.""

We argue, and after a bit, I want to leave, and I was about to help them clean up, but the friend insults me (calls me a momma's boy, what a guy.), and I just leave without cleaning. Think about that next time you insult me. P.S: Will never play Risk: Godstorm again."

Unless you're a DJ with strict rules about your booth, don't ever open up your laptop in a crowded bar. (seen this as well) If your laptop is in a bag, set the bag down gently. Don't leave your electronics out in the sun. Just never take your laptop into the bathroom. It's never worth it. Turn it off when you're not using it.

1,Gaia for President!,"Virginian Presidential Debate, 2019 **MODERATOR:** Good evening from Regent University in Virginia Beach, Virginia. I'm Carl Callahan from the Virginia News Network. We are here for the 2019 Virginian presidential debate. We are joined tonight by the three favorite presidential candidates for this election: former governor of North Carolina and Neo-Republican Mildred Bellows, 2015 presidential candidate libertarian Fanny Tyrone, and eco-warrior Sasha Gaia, representative of the Green Party. Welcome candidates. **BELLOWS:** Thank you for having me here tonight. (APPLAUSE) **TYRONE:** It's an honor to be here. (APPLAUSE) **GAIA:** Yo. (AWKWARD SILENCE, COUGHING) **MODERATOR:** Let's get right to it then. Here's how the debate will work: first we will take questions from the audience, and you will have 2 minutes to answer. --- **Q. Describe your goal if you are elected president.** **BELLOWS:** My administration will be devoted to building Virginia into an ever-stronger nation, by increasing military spending and become more involved in world affairs. **TYRONE:** My administration will focus on obliterating political corruption, and keeping the government at bay from having complete control of your lives. **GAIA:** Here's the deal: humans are evil. Elect me for president and I will not only ban every form of infrastructural development, but also change the world into a green machine! --- **Q. How will your administration address the controversial issue of immigration, most specifically from the CSA in light of their recent KKK uprising?** **BELLOWS:** I'm glad you asked that question, because my administration has carefully thought through the solution. We will be open to many immigrants from stable nations, such as FRES and Delaware, but it's simple logic that our southern border should be closed to all immigration. **TYRONE:** It is a logical fallacy to assume all Confederates are Klan members. A simple background check will suffice to determine if they should be allowed to immigrate to Virginia. **GAIA:** My motto is this: less humans, less problems. We should allow the trees to live in peace. That said, *when* I'm elected, I will close off all immigration from all countries, regardless of Klan affiliation. And anyone who leaves Virginia will never come back. **MODERATOR:** I don't believe the president has that power... **GAIA:** He will when I'm elected. (AWKWARD COUGHING, BABY CRIES, SOMEONE THROWS A BANANA PEEL AT GAIA) --- **Q. What is your position on expansionism?** **BELLOWS:** I believe that, as the successor of America itself, our *responsibility* is to bring as much territory as possible into our land of freedom. My policy is to continue absorbing territory into our realm, in order to strive for peace and stability for every people group within our control. **TYRONE:** The Virginian age of imperialism is over. We are not like the European nations - always fighting over land - we are Virginia! Of course there is always the exception, where it is our moral duty to annex more territory for the greater good of the people. **GAIA:** Any simpleton can see that expansionism is destroying our forests and ecosystems. Therefore, my policy is against annexations, at all costs, no exceptions. --- **MODERATOR:** I believe that's all the time we have tonight. Candidates, thank you for joining us. And now, Virginia, it's time for you to decide: who will be your next president? (APPLAUSE)"

If he can do this not only will I change my stance but I will personally write a letter to the Nobel committee about his scientific accomplishments."

However, they are not targeting people protesting peacefully. The St. Louis media outlets paint a much different story during their live footage than the national outlets paint. I'm a huge fan of Lawrence O'Donnell, but he's dropping the ball on coverage of Ferguson in a major way. He's a part of the problem inciting violence, convincing people that militarized police are attacking peaceful protesters unprovoked. That's not the case and is patently false. The local news shows the actual peaceful protesters sitting along the side of the road holding signs and chanting, etc. No cops around blocking them. No tear gas. No automatic weapons. No looting. No buildings lit on fire by arsonists. The county police have specifically targeted violent people who are mostly from other communities seeking the opportunity to instigate violent conflict; the same people who burned down a gas station and looted a dozen stores; the same group of people whose actions justify police militarization to quell a major mob threat to public safety. That group is not peaceful...far from it. The First Amendment protects the first group of people I mentioned. Arsonists/looters/violent protesters have no Constitutional protection under the First Amendment, and for good reason. Everyone needs to stop acting like the only people in Ferguson are peaceful protesters, because there's far more to the story than that."

You can be in the same room as someone with ebola and not get infected. Hell, someone with ebola can, like, LICK YOU and you won't get infected. Ebola is spread through bodily fluids, so you would have to get someone else's saliva or vomit or blood in your mouth or your eyes.

1,This confirms CCP favors gewns.,"I Avoided CONCORD Subreddit posts seem to succeed where petitions fail, so I may as well give it a go. About two weeks ago I was involved in a CODE ganking fleet in Uedema. On one of the gank runs, the freighter went down, swiftly followed by our gank fleet. However, I was spared for no particular reason. I had no limited engagement with the pilot (I specifically checked at the time) so it wasn't him going suspect or anything. Even if he had gone suspect, this does not explain how the dozen or so other pilots on the killmail all died to CONCORD. I immediately docked up and wrote a petition explaining exactly what had happened. Two weeks later, I received a reply stating that I was not killed by CONCORD because the pilot in question was suspect. Now I knew this just wasn't true as I'd checked at the time. At the same time as ganking the freighter, I had then switched targets to a suspect. I assumed that the GM had mixed the freighter with the suspect, and I replied stating that the freighter could not possibly have been suspect. Within minutes I was given some unrelated copy-paste response about there being some sort of cache problem with my client. I won't quote it directly as I've heard people get in trouble for quoting GMs, but it didn't explain, nor relate to the issue. Now obviously this isn't a massive deal. It appears that it was a one-off glitch, as every single other gank we did in the fleet was executed in the same way, and all resulted in my death. It just bugs me that what could be a fairly game-breaking glitch was treated with such little respect by the GM in question. If I had reported something reproducible and he had treated it with the same carelessness, we'd be in a bit of a mess by now."

1,"You should have sent the employee to a third world missionary youth club, where the child raping wouldn't be reported or cause a scene back home",I run a youth club.

We didn't do anything crazy like tell the Guards. Instead we prayed for the employee and told the raped children to keep their mouths shut. Strangely enough he continued to rape children in the club he was transferred to and no matter how much we prayed for him and no matter many of our clubs we sent him to he just kept doing it. Can any of you think what we might be doing wrong?

1,But but... All reality shows are loud and louder... Comeon why can't Guardians of the Galaxy be recorded like honey booboo it be awesome,"That's like saying it pisses you off when they go from a really bright area to a really dark area. Sure the whole movie could be filmed out in a lighted area so that everything can be seen 100%, but then you are taking out the dynamic range. Sound, like picture, needs to have dynamic range to make an interesting experience. In real life if someone whispers they are quieter, yells they are louder, so all the sound mixer is trying to do is properly emulate that. Make it equivalent to real life. Without dynamic range in sound, horror films would take a real dip. Every scream, music build, loud sting to make you jump out of your seat would suddenly be less impactful and you wouldn't be anywhere near as scared. Just two cents from a sound guy. Also, as shitty as it is, if you want to just watch a movie that is default normalized for you, then watch movies as they come on TV. The FCC requires anything that is played on television to have their audio normalized, so that is a way to see movies that are normalized carefully by hand, and not automatically by a program."

Try filling your tire with that. Fahrenheit offers more precision, in my opinion in certain areas like baking and candy making, trying to measure percentages of a temperature accurately on a candy thermometer for instance would be a nightmare. While logically the metric system makes perfect beautiful sense, there are some areas where some of its uses are better. Measures of temperature and pressure, to me, are the only ones. Everything else should be metric."

1,"and what about the francophone who pay tax dollars should all of their dollar only serve the english majority, give all our money to the english but you frenchie should just shut you mouth and don`t ask for anything the majority rules here.","Other provinces don't have a linguistic minority that comprises 30% of their population. It's not exactly the same situation. - True, but that doesn't mean that it works and there are no flaws in it. I would like to see the numbers on that though. Official bilingualism is not about benefiting the majority. It's about the Francophone minority, who for a very long time were second-class citizens in this province. - So now what of the Anglophone's whose tax dollars fund that and now feel like second class citizens. You are right about the private sector not being bound by the laws. It is not all to do with employees and customer base though. Companies are going to go with the flow or they will face the backdraft of complaints. They are not doing it because they want to, they are doing it because they have been given no other choice to. There are lots of employers that want to hire people based on qualifications,but unfortunately have to go on who is bilingual, not who who is best suited. If French is a non issue in this province like you say then why are so many people leaving the province and saying I can't get a job because I am not Bilingual. I have been turned down for jobs because of that reason many a time, and the courses to learn French are not cheap! I even tried to get PETL to help pay for it because I am currently on EI and went to see them about retraining. I was denied for the French course."
