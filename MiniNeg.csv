0,Keep the dog dump the dude is the only answer dog owners ever need.,"SNW and the engagement BIL Hey gang! I found time to write a bit so here it goes! Remember BIL is dating now SIL and he's now thinking of marrying her. We were sitting in the room at the il's house just us three. BIL is talking to DH about it. SIL has a dog that she's had for years. It was a gift to her by her father when he became very ill, near death. The reality hit him that life is short and he decided to start making good on some of his promises before he died. He always told SIL he would get her a dog, they were a military family, and he'd always say the next place we move I'll get it for you. So he got her this dog at that time and she loves her dog and he has sentimental value to her. Now, BIL has not yet met this dog because you know it's serious when you meet the dog. BIL sates to DH: Well the dog has to go. I have allergies and I can't be living with a dog. I know the dog has sentimental meaning for her because of her dad but my health is more important than a dog. She's waiting for me to meet the dog because she wants him to slowly warm up to me. This is stupid, it's just a dog... I don't see what the big deal is. I want to marry her but if we get married we'll already have to get an apartment and that costs money there (both of them at the time were living with their parents and would meet each other for dates and such). If we keep the dog then we have to pay extra money for pet rent and I'm not paying extra money for a dog!!! DH is just nodding his head and listening (he's pretty laid back and quiet always like this guess it's true opposites attract). I'm thinking how rude is this guy? He wants to marry her and is supposed to love her but can't have compassion for what she loves??? I know he's SNOT JR. For sure. Anyway he meets the dog and they get engaged. They have all these big events that I find my way out of because I can't stand being around them. They had a family celebration right after he proposed and a joint couple shower. SNW knows how creative and crafty I am, especially after my wonderful diy wedding decor, so she asks me to help her decorate for the rehearsal dinner. I reluctantly agree to help her. DH and I have been married over 3 years at this point. SNW has never made any efforts to call, text, smoke signal, or communicate with me in any way or form any relationship with me. Can't remember if I posted about this before but I did invite her to an event to be the bigger person, but she basically fought me even giving it to her. The event was based on a book and I wanted to buy her the book and put the tickets inside as a Christmas gift. She was like oh I don't want a book. And then proceeded to text DH about how she doesn't want whatever I'm trying to get her, that he knows the type of gifts she likes and to stick to that. I was so angry... I was raised knowing when people get you a gift you accept because the person thought about you and took their time to get it for you so be grateful! Guess not everyone learned that. I still invite her after my moms advise but said well I was trying to do this for you but since you didn't want it I'm asking you now would you like to go with me. Then she's like oh I would love to go I had no idea thats what it was, super nice in front of everyone. We went to the event and she straight up did not talk to me the whole time and went off in her own during the intermissions. Sorry for going off topic but you get the point. Now all of a sudden she's blowing me up about this wedding rehearsal. She texts several times a day and calls about her ideas and sends me pics. She's always like Hi how are you then goes for what she wants... I'm not fooled at all, she never cared how I was doing for over three years. She says Oh well SIL and I have been talking about the plans and blah blah blah. Basically trying to run in my face that she talks to SIL all the time and she's being involved in the planning. unlike with my wedding, but that's because she got mad at me for not doing what she wanted and did CBF the rest of the time I was planning. I tell DH about this sudden change of behavior and how much involved SNW is in this wedding as compared to ours. He suggests well maybe because she has a good relationship with SIL she realizes she needs to do better with you and this is her way of reaching out to you... I say maybe but I know its all fake..."

As I handed her the receipt, another guy walks in, past the automatic doors that were put on halfway open to accommodate my last customer. My shift lead is standing by the doors, keys in hand. ""Sir,"" my shift lead calls after him, ""it's 10 o clock, we are closed."" ""Oh, I know, I'll only be a sec!"" Guy keeps walking back towards the pet stuff. My shift lead lets my last customer out, and stands by the doors, and I can see she's fuming. Here comes Special Guy. ""See! I was only a second! Haha!"" Special Guy literally puffs out his chest with pride. I ring up his 15 big cans of dog food, and bag them in his gross smelling bag. I tell him his total, he pays, and he's watching both of us, and we are less than thrilled with him. ""Geez, ladies, lighten up! I was only a second!"" My shift lead shakes her head. ""Yes, but you're cutting into our closing ops, and yes, 5 minutes DOES make a difference."" She unlocks the doors to let him out, bidding him adieu. And his parting words to us? ""I was only a second though! Good night!"" Good lord, dude. We are open 14 hours; you had all damn day! Also, before my head gets bitten off, I'm aware some people work doubles or long shifts; I am one of them (my other job). But there is a grocery store open until midnight, and the mini mart open until 11pm that can see you through. Sorry, just...argh!!!!!"

My understanding is that you don't want to put green branches into an aquarium. I've got a couple small tanks (5.5g, 2.5g) that I'd like to put these in, but only if I don't have to leave them outside for year(s) first. The branches are small, the biggest one has a maximum diameter of 0.75 inches, but they're mostly closer to 0.25-0.5 inches. The outer black bark is gone, but the inner red bark is still on them. Here's my questions: 1) Is there any way I can quickly dry them out in an oven or something? Would they be safe to boil and use at that point? 2) Usually the things I've read say that the bark needs to be removed or it'll slowly peel off. As long as it were to not peel off in tiny pieces, and as long as it were safe, I wouldn't mind that. I don't have a sandblaster to remove bark with either. Is it out of the question to leave the bark on? (ie is it super obnoxious or toxic?) Thanks guys!"

In the four games today (Christmas, of all days) I've had three teammates tell me that I'm ""absolute shit"" and to go ""kill myself"". What happened to this community? It feels like a MOBA community (not quite as bad as LoL, but it's starting to have a familiar feel to me) more than it used to feel just like a bunch of people trying to compete yet still enjoying the competition, even if someone is having a bad game. It makes me hesitant to keep at it, and I was excited about getting back into it. :'("

About 2 months later he had a candle burning in his room with the window open. The wind blew a sombrero off the wall and onto the candle.

And it doesn't mean there are no talented women (really?); just that by-and-large women and men tend to have slightly different talents and inclinations. What we need is equality of opportunity, and a willingness not to stereotype on the basis of aggregate behaviours, rather than equality of outcome. By far my best ever boss was a woman: calm, collected, fair, highly-competent, and treated everyone with respect. There are lots of good, intelligent women out there doing good work. And women are not the enemy. We'll just end up as warped and bitter as feminists if we go down that path."

I've often created fun and interesting decks for non-competitive play. I like to try strange decks just to see if I can get them to work. I think it's fun and it's one of the ways I have found to alleviate frustration when grinding ladder. A problem, though, is that I'll make a funky pirate shaman deck or a rogue deck with only two minions, etc. and want to just dick around and have fun with it. I'll go into casual and lose to aggro shaman or control Mage enough times that I feel like I should be playing a ranked deck to have a little more fun, and I'm back to grinding ladder. This brings me to my point. You can choose the class you play against in practice mode, letting you see how your deck fares in certain match ups. I think it would be fun and innovating to be able to choose a deck for the innkeeper to play against you. This could have practical benefits (like a mirror match to test out changes in a ranked deck) or it could be really fun (giving the innkeeper a golden Milhouse Manastorm). It could even be used to mess with deck interplay (thief rogue against a stacked deck). What do you guys think?"

You can program the best robot to fight literally anything but it follows a set of rules that can be exploited, learned and outplayed. A titans mind, while vast, is still finite. Take Ronin for example, the sword titan. Often, he states ""We are stronger together, pilot"" and it's true. With his processing speed, algorithms and logic combined with a humans intuition and risk/reward assessment (robots err on one side or the other, a human does not) they can make combined decisions leading to the best outcome. Also. A human can sacrifice themselves, a titan cannot sacrifice their pilot. Alone they are formidable, but together, they are only challenged by an equal."

0,"I honestly wouldnt mind if DE decided to take a look at all weapons that were ""X weapon but worse in every way"" and give them some unique mechanic so that we dont just have like 20-30 useless weapons compared to the others.","Has DE Learned to Work Around Power Creep? Let me start by saying power creep will always be a thing in WF and I do not see that ever stopping. I do however believe that DE has taken some steps to slowing it. Passives are amazing! They change not only how you build weapons and what you decide to use but also how you play the game. A perfect example is the Telos Boltace which is quickly becoming a go to melee. Is it as powerful as the Galatine Prime? Debatable, but for killing a single tanky target no. But the way you play with the Telos Boltace changes everything. A somewhat good example of how weapon passives change the game is the Borderlands series. I would never want to see WF be as crazy as Borderlands, but some this are already starting to line up. For instance the Fomorian Accelerant mod for the Drakgoon adds a passive to make shots bounce off walls. This is similar to the Conferance Call shotgun in Borderlands 2. Furis's Winds of Purity mod turns it into a Moxie weapon. Why cant warframe have weapons that you can throw the clip out to explode doing damage equal to the bullets remaining? Or a sniper rifle the shoots a volley like Ivaras bow? Just add more cool passives and players will build around them."

0,Currently in stat and holy shit this just helped enormously in getting the concept of P tests down,"This isn't that hard. I'm not going to go all hypothesis testy for this, but we can certainly calculate a confidence interval on his measurement. If we believe that p = 1/3 and we have enough data points (which at nearly 300,000 we do), we can estimate a standard error for our measured p using sqrt{p(1-p)/n}. A 95% confidence interval would then be 1.96*se(p) = 0.00086. Given the actual data we can say with 95% confidence that misha's true summoning rate falls within the interval 33.38% +- 0.086% or [33.29%, 33.47%]. Increasing n an order of magnitude to just about 3 million games, would bring the lower limit of our confidence interval to 33.35%, which is above 1/3. We would need about 3 million games to more properly test the claim that Misha might be summoned at a rate higher than 1/3. (at least for p-value of 0.05 and a 2-sided interval, and maybe other things I'm forgetting at the moment.)"

0,"It only matters in the sense that it means Trump wasn't just bringing up something irrelevant in an attempt to smear someone who he doesn't like, he was also spewing false information.",And what the fuck would it matter if such a tape did exist?

0,Fair enough on the criticism and I agree with your sentiment towards body autonomy but the government already does limit autonomy.,"No, of course not. I have seen a fair share of crazy liberal feminists who believe that women are entitled to everything because they are women, but I have also met plenty more women who work their ass off and achieve everything quite fairly. Now, the minority of women who support the *my choice* abortion are those who are, quite frankly, crazy. Again, those are the 'fringe' parts of liberalism. Classical liberalism is nothing like that. They believe in both rights *and* responsibilities. I am not even a liberal, I am a conservative and so I feel that all men and women should be free to do as they please with their body. The concept of body autonomy is essential to the functioning of human rights. If we do not have body autonomy then everything else falls apart and we certainly should not have the expectation that everyone will defend their freedom with the barrel of a gun because that's not how one should defend their freedom, unless absolutely necessary. Anyway, I think I am digressing a little. Don't use an internet forum as a barometer for what women think, especially two chromosomes. That place is an effective safe space, much like coontown or fatpeoplehate used to be. Plus, a lot of women think that 'being a man' is about acting like a dick and, so, a lot of young feministas basically act like that to try look 'hard and cool', like teenage boys. Irony is, most of them are 18-23 year olds..."

0,"You already have the capacity to sue foreign governments (and vice versa), but this caveat expands it to the ability to sue for war crimes essentially.",I actually think it is a good thing. To allow Americans to sue foreign governments opens up a door you cannot close. Foreign governments would then be able to sue American citizens.

0,Swerved.,"He's doing way better than Cena was. WWE used to mute Cena's reactions, pipe in chants, and run an edited version for the West coast feed (which aired on tape delay) for Cena. At the PPVs they could only mute it but it'd be obvious people were booing Cena, so many people that were on the West Coast would only hear the boos at PPVs and would be surprised. Maybe because of the proliferation of the internet they aren't trying to do that now. But Reigns actually does get cheers and the boos aren't even that bad. He gets booed on his entrance, but he's such a good wrestler that usually during and after his matches the crowd can't help but pop. Cena was a garbage wrestler so he'd just get booed throughout the matches. When Cena would fire up it'd be even worse. When Reigns fires up most people actually like to see the Superman punch and Spear. Cena of course lasted for a decade plus. I'm sure Reigns can do that too. I think Reigns outside of promo work is a way better wrestler than Cena already. He looks cooler, has cooler moves, sells a lot better and works better matches all around. Heck even his promos, I see more potential, because Cena would just make kiddy jokes mostly."
