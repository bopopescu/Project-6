0,You are correct based on my 15 years of watching pro football.,"The number of steps is irrelevant, the receiver could take two or twenty and not make a completed catch. Okay 20 would be a stretch because the catch is over when the player has regained control over his momentum [1]. A player that catches the ball and gets both feet down in bounds by the tips of his shoes only counts as a catch if he maintains control until he stops moving out of bounds. So stopping is one way of establishing that the player has regained control and completed the pass. But receivers don't stop moving in the middle of the field when they catch the ball, so what else counts. Changing direction or accelerating by an action that can be attributed to the receiver also count. This is what is meant by football move. Changing direction of motion is fairly straight forward since falling uncontrollably doesn't result in a spontaneous change in direction. Accelerating by receiver action can be accomplished by running or by lunging forward by pushing off the ground by extending the player's legs. So back to the three steps. The first two are in the process of the fall and do not meaningfully represent control by the player, since they don't represent a meaningful way of changing the speed/direction of the player. If you doubt this, ask could Bryant have stopped instead of taking those steps if he wanted to. The third step is him tripping over the defender, and again doesn't represent restored control. And the reaching for the pylon? If Bryant had been able to plant his feet and push off when reaching, it would likely have counted. But extending a limb doesn't demonstrate control since his body was still moving forward in an uncontrolled path. It is up to the refs to determine when they feel the player has regained control enough so that they can make a move that is independent of their motion when they catch the ball. [1] I am not a trained ref, nor an expert on the nfl rulebook. This is just my understanding that seems to fit with the rulings on the field."

0,Sounds like the US.. Rural v. Urban.,"Pakistani here! In the 60s, we were very progressive. Free market economy, thriving banking sector, largely secularist (Alcohol, clubbing and everything was part of society). Then the cold war happened. In the mid 70s Prime Minister Bhutto, a socialist, was forced to outlaw alcohol by pressure from the Islamic clergy. He gave in to several other of their demands and that's when the left begun to fall. Bhutto was also anti American, opting to ally himself with the Soviets and China. So naturally, when the Shah (Pro US) was overthrown in Iran by the Shia religious faction (Anti US and Saudi), it was time for Bhutto to bite the dust. The US helped the then Chief of Army Zia ul Haq to take power and ousted Bhutto. Bhutto was hanged shortly afterwards. Now Zia was super Islamist and nationalist. And the US wanted to deter Soviet influence in the then Socialist Republic of Afghanistan. So then came the Afghan Jihad. The US and Pakistan Army started the Al Qaeda and the Taliban to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan. To strengthen this, massive nationalistic and Islamist propaganda and policies were introduced. This included lashing in public, making it mandatory to wear Islamic clothing (people wore western before the 80s), making it mandatory to learn government dictated Islamic studies and Pakistan studies (wasn't even a subject in school before this) and all sorts of policies to radicalize the masses. He also introduced heavy Islamic laws such as blasphemy and sharia. Basically, Pakistan went from being bad to worse in the 80s to pump propaganda and control the masses. The cold war ended, the US left and in the 90s, Pakistan was left in shambles with a radicalized public and a poor economy. When Musharraf came to power in 1999, he introduced liberal and free market policies. Bless that man otherwise Pakistan would be a complete shithole like Iraq or Afghanistan now. Today, urban Pakistan is progressive and liberal whilst rural Pakistan is still Islamist and radicalized. Issue is, it's difficult to de-radicalize two generations of people indoctrinated with religious and nationalistic propaganda in the rural areas while it was very easy to do so in the urban areas within a decade where people have access to free media and western education. So there's a rift in Pakistan now. Rural folks see urban folks as *shameless* and westernized whilst urban folks look at them as backward and blame them for pulling the country back."

The lube is there because you can feel the wetness on her bedsheets and she takes it like an absolute champ. But the size and length of sex make her sore.

How to counter: Skill 1: If he jumps in with just cc him, run away or burst him from distance, because he has no escape other than his ult. If he is fleeing, use a zoning skill, like chang'e, or use DoT skills. Skill 2: Is his only source of damage, so if he has it on CD you have like 8 seconds where he has nothing to do, so he will be just useless. Compared to other jungler such as serqet, he can only kill you when he has his 2 up, while serqet can kill you with plain basics, or shred you with his 1. That's why i think that skills does not need a nerf, because is his only way to kill. Skill 3: It's plain damage. Skill 4: You just have to buy aegis, beads or magi's blessing(yes you can just buy one item and literally counter it) To know when to use beads or aegis, you just need to watch your life when you go below 35% of life he will ulti you.

0,That sleeping mutt grunt is one of the most comforting sounds ever.,"Wow. Seeing this just stirred up a memory I haven't thought about in a long time. I had this great dog growing up. A big mutt who liked to sneak up stairs at night and sleep in my room (he was supposed to stay in the mud room). I'd come down off the bed when he came in and would sleep next to him under a blanket. He used to make this funny noise when you pet him as he was laying down trying to sleep. ""Mmmmmm"" like some sort of dog purr. I recorded it on a Yak Bak one time and sort of forgot about that toy. My dog died later that year. I'm not sure how much longer after that, but I found the Yak Bak and hit play. That recording I made of him was still on there. I was stunned, I had forgotten all about it. I kept that Yak Bak recording as long as I could, playing it when I missed him. Eventually it crapped out and I lost that recording. I wish I could hear it again now, but the memory will have to do."

0,Patriotic tears of joy were shed.,"Strolling, rolling, trolling through Europe, people often ask meed what it means to be an American. I tell 'em it's triumph. Triumph. Triumph when we nuke our enemies. Triumph when when peer down from the moon and laugh heartily at Russia. Triumph when we depose one dictator after another. Triumph when we break into the homes of terrorist kingpins on the other side of Earth and shoot them in the face. Triumph when we use flying robots to bomb other terrorists in Afghanistan, and other nuclear robots to explore Mars. Triumph when we free Europe from Nazis. Triumph. Triumph. Triumph. But it's not just the the big things, see? It's the way I can set up lawn chairs at my friends house on the Texas Rio Grande and share a toast to freedom while watching Mexicans charge into gunfire to enter my country. It's the way an Italian cabbie sits up straight and floors the gas when he hears my accent. It's seeing the wide eyes and bead of sweat running down the forehead of a German customs agent when he opens my passport. It's the way a French waiter hangs his head when I refuse the wine and ask for Coke instead, in English knowing full well he understands me (and that they have it). The way an Aussie blushes and leans into the urinal next to me in the bathroom, or the scowl that meets my smirk when I tip an English waiter in US dollars covered with Washington's face. The way small mobs of Canadian school children follow me from a distance to see what a free man looks like, or how heads timidly rise and women gather when my accent stops the music in the clubs of Amsterdam. Triumph. Every bit of it, triumph. That's what it means to be an American."

0,"After further reflection, I'm curious why you think it costs Wizards more time to unban a card than to ban a card.","I think we definitely want the same thing. I make no bones about my soap box - I do think Cloud of Faeries is a broken card and I feel (yes, no hard evidence again to back it up) that the only thing holding it back is click intensity. When Tom was tracking data it basically displayed that CoF combo had an absurd win rate - barely anyone who piloted the deck didn't post a winning record. If the only thing holding back a deck from dominance is the clock, I think there's a problem. But that's beside the point - your position regarding Invigorate makes sense - there is no cost to unbanning/banning except time. I think this is the crux of so many issues: **Wizards doesn't have the time to be as attentive to Pauper as we want.** This is not an indictment of Wizards - they're a business and Pauper is a small slice of that pie. In an ideal world we could try Invigorate for a while and then either keep it around or let it die a natural death. The problem is that it appears easier for Wizards to add to the ban list in an effort to save time. My only real quibble with your post is about Cranial Plating, and I only bring it up because I was there. Prior to Pauper being sanctioned the then PDC Community was at a cross roads: Cranial Plating was banned and the Artifact Lands were restricted. Myself and a few other PDC regulars decided to test fully powered Affinity. What we found was that Artifact Lands were no longer a problem and Cranial Plating was still overpowered. A few weeks before the sanctioning PDC changed their ban list to reflect that. What then happened was Wizards used a cached edition of the ban list originally. There was some backlash from the PDC community and they changed their stance. Sadly I can't find the exact email. Regardless, thanks for the discussion. I think it's obvious we both just want Pauper to survive and thrive, even if we have different ideas of what the next step should be."

0,"Thanks for that sometimes I wonder where our once thriving and progressive, national brain trust vanished to, it is still here, only buried by the noise we are to accept as news.","You bring up a great point that highlights one of the toughest parts of the US's immigration system. Immigration is one of the major issues in our country where we see many lines blurred. Most people perceive Republicans as heavily anti-immigrant, however that is not always true. Farm owners, and the agricultural industry as a whole, often circumvent the law, and lure migrant Mexican workers into the US with promise of better pay then they make in Mexico. This happens in red states and blue states, by republicans and democrats. This has complicated the legislation process, and is a reason why we haven't seen comprehensive immigration reform in decades. We saw Reagan and Bush use executive actions to grant amnesty to undocumented immigrants, and we're seeing it again because we don't have representatives in congress that are willing to lead, and craft comprehensive immigration reform. President Obama's executive action on immigration is not controversial, and is a step in the right direction for fixing our broken immigration system. It's cliche to say broken immigration system, but the system is extremely broken, and does not look to be fixed wholly anytime soon. I don't understand why people are so upset that the President wants to crack down on border crossers, and broaden the tax base by granting temporary citizenship. The action also starts to prioritize deportations by going after those who pose a threat to our society, opposed to just willy-nilly going after everyone without rhyme or reason. Truth is, we don't have the resources for that, and it's not Obama's fault. The system is broken, and needs to be fixed. This is a step in the right direction. Let's be thankful someone in Washington wants to set the foundation for reform. Immigration is an extremely complicated issue, and it seems most people are upset because they either don't understand the immigration problem, or don't trust the president."

0,Excellent point.,"I wouldn't say being a male feminist necessarily gets you more sex, but having a feminist culture almost certainly increases the amount of sex that is being had. Think about it, feminism removed social mores about women not being able to sleep around, have casual sex, and keep pushing marriage further and further into the later years. The end result is more young women for me to have casual sex with. Feminism is a great thing really, TRPers who hate feminism don't really understand how awesome it has made our sex lives (although its generally the incel redpillers who hate feminism the most I think)"

0,"I haven't had many years of experience in flash, but I could never get the tween frames to not give me horrifying monsters.","Well, if you were traditionally animating sure. But flash animations don't need to be individually keyframed, unless that's the style you're going for and a masochist. You have built in 'tween' options where the program will take two keyframes and do the work for the inbetween frames, or, if you're more inclined (and want to make an easier to manage project) you can use programmatic tweening libraries like gtween / write your own code. Programmatic tweening involves creating an element, then using actionscript to tell it how to move (looks like javascript). So pretty much you'd say ""hey circle, spin around 8 times over 6 seconds"" then you have the option for that to use a callback and trigger the next element to go and do its thing. I spent years doing flash animations for advertising and animatics, and really the only thing preventing us from going 60fps was (at the time) frame dropping. And in the instance of ads, you're super restricted on compiled SWF filesize, coming in at 30-60KB max typically. When everything is animated with code you can quickly clobber the computer trying to render it if you're not careful. I also remember a conversation when we were creating a test 60fps batch that went something like ""oh man, that looks too smooth, it's un-natural"". I personally thought it looked more eye catching, but some of the older guys were just getting used to the idea of animated gifs being used for ads. So yeah, more work .. not so much.. Potential for flash bogging down like the pigbeast resourcehog it is, pretty high."

0,That's great nut I don't think this is a rational type of thing,"Not always, but I went through a phase. In general I'm a bit more paranoid and anxious than average so it was easy to attest to that. Also, having gone through that and come out the other side, I can comfortably say that I'm not worried about it. The one thread that kept me sane was, despite the possibility, I know she would never do that. And I feel strongly about it. The other way to look at it is that a relationship needs trust. There are really only four outcomes in this situation, and the only good ones are when you trust your partner. If you get burned it's not on you but them. + You trust her, she cheats: You're happy until you find out, then you end it + You trust her, she doesn't cheat: you're happy + You don't trust her, she cheats: you're unhappy, find out, then end it + You don't trust her, she doesn't cheat: you're unhappy and will ruin the relationship. Trust is the only happy ending. That's why it's so important, why it's so fragile, and why it takes so much to build."

So in the books it is clearly stated how Tommen and Margaery do not consummate their marriage at all, and Cersei is extremely jealous of her because she thinks that Margaery will be the new, young, beautiful Queen that will end up over throwing her. In this weeks episode (and I know the TV makers are making the kids older in the show so that it isn't as creepy to watch) the bedroom scene between Tommen and Margaery happened. My question is, what's going to happen between Cersei and Margaery now? Cersei is out to get Margaery by trying to get her arrested because she does everything in her power to prove that Margaery is not being true to her husband and is having an affair. We know this because she drinks a special tea to make it so that she cannot get pregnant. It is speculated that she is having an affair with the singer that comes and sings to her and her friends constantly. Why else would she need to drink this tea unless she was having sex, and she is presumed to still be a virgin because she never consummated her marriage with Remly, and that's the whole reason she was able to be married to Joffery, who then died on their wedding day, and then Tommen. Once all this comes out Margaery turns the attention around to Cersei. Cersei ends up getting arrested. She eventually has to confess her sins of incest after all these years, and then repents by having to walk through King's Landing naked. How is this going to play out now? Is Margaery just going to expose Cersei so this happens? The TV writers cannot take this out it's such a monumental moment in the series, and really shapes Cersei for the future regarding her character. Any thoughts?"

I'm not sure why now I was so fascinated by this movie, but around the age of 5 something clicked and I began to *really* understand what was taking place in the story. This lead to nightmares where I would wake up screaming in the night every night. Took years to stop having nightmares, but I still awkwardly glance at drains in bathroom floors, I have a desire to brutally beat every clown I see and I still get chills every time I glance down a storm drain, knowing that even as a grown man I would scream like a little girl if I so much as *think* I saw a glimpse of something lurking inside.

We don't quite know the pecking order at all, nor do we know if Hamilton is going to have a 2011-esque season, or if Massa is going to continue his fantastic form, or if Vettel is back to his old self, or if McLaren have something up their sleeve. The only thing I can really say is that I don't expect Red Bull to do well at all. Ricciardo can lead, but the loss of Vettel and Newey is considerable, and their initial problems and especially quotes (from Kvyat etc) are damning, even moreso than the desperate-looking ones from last year. I also expect Kvyat to suck hard. Also Toro Rosso are looking mighty. 1. Hamilton 2. Rosberg 3. Vettel 4. Massa 5. Bottas 6. Raikkonen 7. Alonso 8. Ricciardo 9. Button 10. Grosjean Teams: 1. Mercedes 2. Williams/Ferrari 3. Ferrari/Williams (way too close to call) 4. McLaren 5. Red Bull 6. Lotus 7. Toro Rosso 8. Force India 9. Sauber 10. Manor"

I know some refuse to believe these sorts of things would be done, but they have historic precedent, this is how our governments operate.

Devs, It would be so, so amazing to have two slots for a keybind for each action. For example, I would love to bind the ""Pull"" action to both MMB and to LControl. Currently, the only way to do this is to pop up the console and use the setbind command, but that means I have to open up UDKinput or whatever and figure out the actual name for the Pull command and the name for the LControl key. If we just had two slots for a key next to the action name in the options, allowing us to click inside each one to set two different keys for each action, it would be awesome for the 30 of us still playing this game when we try to install it on a new computer. :) P.S.

0,"beautiful, like a poet... bravo.","There are several, pick your sugar. One time we were hanging out with several friends, and we were talking about vacation spots. Where would you want to go for a vacation? and she replied ""Anywhere as long as I can be alone with westop."" She turned beet red after realizing what she said, and the group teased her about it, and told us to get a room. Another time I was extremely busy at work, she called me and I told her I was really busy and stressed right now so I couldn't really talk. She told me ""I wish I could be there to help."" I said thanks we said goodbye. Then 10 minutes later she appears at my office with coffee and donuts for everyone. She then came to me kissed me and said ""I hope this helps!"" There was also this girl I dated who I dated who was very tomboyish. We were out at the mall and we passed the build-a-bear shop thing. She was taking small peeks at it constantly. Bit her lips a bit, it was obvious she wanted to go in but felt it wouldn't fit her. So I said that I wanted to get something for my niece lets go inside. Her face lit up and said ""I guess... I'll have to helpyoupickoneout!!!!"" It was so adorable, especially with the contrast to her appearance. One day I made cheesecake to cheer up my girlfriend, she was on one of her supposed diets again so she was very pouty and said ""I hate you so much right now!"" as she eats the cheesecake, then when she finished her first slice she stuck her tongue out at me so I kissed her which took her entirely off guard, so I started kissing down her neck from behind, she said ""Stop it! I'm trying to be mad at you!"" as I slowly moved my hand up her leg. She then kisses me and I poke her stomach and tell her ""eat any more and you'll get fat"" and I ran away to my room with her chasing me saying ""You ass!"". She catches up to me and pushes me on the bed and she took her shirt off. So I ask ""I thought you hate me?"" so she smacked me with a pillow than kissed me, which proceeded according to my evil plan. There was also the time where she woke me up one morning and stared into my eyes, and told me she loved me for the first time. The sun was coming in through the windows, you could hear the birds singing outside, it was a perfect moment, so I replied with a kiss and I love you too. I smiled, my heart tingled as she radiated happiness. She put her forehead against mine and we looked into each others eyes for a moment, and she kissed me again. It was such a sweet and beautiful moment that only made it hurt so much more as I reminisce about it. Somewhere in my heart I knew that the words were empty, that this wasn't love. In hindsight I never loved her instead just acted the part of a loving boyfriend, which only makes that moment so very bittersweet."

0,Confronting these psycho drama people only throws more logs on the fire.,"I'd like to chime in here, as someone who is that passive aggressive best friend (it's been on my mind a lot since I realized that's how I act.) This is the take from my perspective. I don't want to be passive aggressive about my best friend. I'd like to say, ""You did X and I felt Y,"" or ""You did X even though you say that you Y,"" because that's who I am in other relationships. But I don't feel like my best friend is on that level. He's one of those gaslighters, a completely unreasonable person who puts on the mask of composed civility the moment you criticize him. You can't confront issues because he'll start slinging out defenses while simultaneously slipping past every point you try to make. It's absolutely maddening. You end up in a situation where you can't confront issues and the problems you never dealt with start to bottleneck. You think about 8 months ago when they stood you up at the restaurant, or a year and a half ago when they said that they would *never* watch X, even though you recommended it, and this week they want to tell you that they're watching cool new show X and you should totally try it. And you start to hate them, little by little, as you think about how all of the components of their personality fit together into someone who isn't capable of realizing when they're contradicting their own self-concept and how toxic it makes you feel. You want to get out of the relationship but you can't, maybe because you're weak or because you're lonely or because you're desperate, but you feel disempowered to fix what you already have. So you turn into a passive aggressive shit because you are externalizing your poisonous lack of self-efficacy. It's gross, it's totally not cool, but that's at least the rationale I think. I like to say that passive aggressiveness is the graceless form that a desire for change takes when it has been malnourished and contorted. By the time someone becomes passive aggressive, there is usually already a pretty serious feeling writhing around in there. And in at least a few cases, this happens because person A creates strains that they don't recognize as strain, which makes negativity from person B seem completely baseless and irrational."

0,"Change it to 6 mana, and 6 attack, and we might have a card that could be used, but it's not good enough as it stands.","Don't really know if it helps Dragon decks (my impression is that it's really bad). The two major problems most dragon decks face are roughly: * Bad early game * Mediocre win conditions and this card doesn't really help with either. Plus, it just feels bad for a big card - most 7+ mana cards are only playable if they have something beyond just their body to offer - this is just a BGHable body that probably doesn't even usually pass the vanilla test (it needs about +6 Health to be roughly 'vanilla' - hard to get on curve, and needs a ridiculous number of dragons to die.)"

0,*you're,"First of all, I now know that nice guys are very unattractive and can seem very desperate, and I don't blame you for not dating them. But back then, I was young and stupid, and I didn't understand this. No one taught me how to attract women. If anything, cartoons like Johnny Bravo taught me that being straight forward and blunt will get you shot down. More importantly, I was always attracted to girls who were nice to me. It didn't matter if they were just friends or nice in another way, but I really really liked nice girls. I guess this was the main reason I was so nice to them, I was hoping it would work both ways, but now I know it doesn't, and now I know if a guys is always nice to girls it makes him seem desperate. I wouldn't say I was expecting love/affection (I was too young to care about sex so that wasn't relevant) in return, but I admit I was hoping for it, and I guess that is what makes a Nice Guy a Nice Guy. As you probably have guessed, I never attracted girls this way and still never had a girlfriend. That's fine, like I said I understand now how unattractive it is. But I **never** complained about not getting anything in return. I didn't threat the girls any differently, I don't think they are bitches, and I completely understand them. I didn't complain about it to friends, I didn't complain about it on the internet and I also don't believe the whole ""women only like assholes"" bullshit. A more accurate saying would be ""women/people prefer confident partners"" From my experience with my friends who also were nice guys, they never complained about it either and while they sometimes were sad/depressed about it, they just dealt with it. I wasn't just nice to girls really, I was nice to everyone hoping they would be nice in return, but now I know it doesn't always work that way. So my question is, what's with all the hatred for the nice guys? It's fine if you find us unattractive. It's fine if you never date us. But why do you have to call us manipulative assholes, when we are really just confused about how to attract girls? Aren't we allowed to make mistakes? Sorry for making yet another thread about this, I tried looking through the other threads and while I found a lot of complaints about nice guys I couldn't really find the reason why you hate me instead of just accepting that I made mistakes."

0,"I think that the low food and drink spawns were fun, but it was ridiculously hard to find everything else.","Why the 'loot glitch' made AR more fun for me. First of all, the loot in the new AR actually exists. Trust me, I found a revolver, backpack and enough survival supplies within 15 minutes; I survived for 5 days. I could just be used to it because I play DayZ Standalone. The first thing that I noticed (besides the fact that there was less loot) was that I actually met a friendly player. I gave him food and we became buddies. Similar things happened later on - I even got a group of 5 friendlies (without using the group feature). Meanwhile, I heard very little about Killing on Sight in the chat, as I would normally have heard a lot of it about an hour into the game. What I'm trying to say is that the lack of ammo and guns makes people not want to fight eachother. Sure, we did get attacked by a few knife murderers, but that was actually funny instead of the same old: Get sprayed by military weapons then have the player boast about his kills and badges. Of course, many people reacted negatively to the glitch, but I actually think that it has done some good for the game. I think that military weapons should exist, but most players will be using civilian weapons so that they're not as much as a threat as a machine-gunning bandit. Just my thoughts, please take them into consideration."

Even after missing the last two games he finished in the top 25 in the country in passing yards and without him the last two games UMass's offense reverted to something similar to what we saw our first two FBS years.

He ignored bot lane, dragon, etc etc. The Lucian and I destroyed the lane on our own, but I got angry, really angry because this Hecarim continuously portrayed troll behavior, and he didn't talk. Because of me trying to talk some sense in the team and getting mad at Hecarim I got reported and suspended for 14 days.

0,"This is nuts, but still not as crazy as my own Aegon=Benjamin Button=Egg Tinfoil.","(Spoilers All) Get ready for the craziest theory you will ever read. Ned was dragged up to Baelor's Sept and executed. Obviously, that happened and many people saw it. EXCEPT what if it wasn't him? What if it was his face, but not *him*? The key to the entire thing is Varys. So Ned Stark, Warden of the North and beloved Lord of Winterfell, is tried and executed for treason at the hands of Joffery Baratheon. Ned is still recovering from his broken leg, and things aren't going so well. It didn't set right, it's probably infected. He doesn't know what's going to happen, but he knows a trip to the Wall ain't exactly going to be a fun trip, probably lethal. Varys knows this too. Which is why Varys concocts a last minute plan to get Ned out of harms way. Varys stumbles upon Syrio Forel in the aftermath of his fight with Meryn Trant. Meryn Trant survived the fight, yet he never says what happened? You would think if he killed the First Sword of Braavos, he'd brag about it, right? Well he never does. What I think is that Syrio knocked him out after getting seriously messed up. Not lethal, mind you, but he's not in good shape. Varys finds him, and also Varys knows something about Forel that not many know. Syrio Forel is a Faceless Man. Varys asks Syrio Forel to change his face into Ned Stark, and replace Ned during the trial. Before Syrio declines, Varys explains that a supporter of traitor isn't going to be receiving the best medical attention, but Varys could arrange for the ship taking 'Ned' to Eastwatch to have a Maester on it, AND maybe the ship sinks after a pit stop in Braavos? After Feast of Crows, it's revealed that many ships traveling to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea stops in Braavos. So Varys basically gives Syrio Forel an irresistible offer, medical attention and a ride home. Obviously this doesn't go as planned as he's killed on Baelor's Sept. Some clues to this are the fact that Arya claims that her father looks bad all over, as opposed to solely a leg injury. He barely looks like him, she says. Some claim it's just the distance, maybe Ned's treatment in the black cells. What if it's the fact that Syrio Forel has been beaten half to death with a sword, not had his leg broken by a horse? Plus it's stated that Ned limps to the stand, but how? With a crushed leg, he would have had to crawl. Then Sansa, in Clash of Kings, says that her father's head doesn't even look right. (Maybe the death of a Faceless Man affects his powers? Distortion of the illusion perhaps?) and Catelyn says that Ned's bones look too small, maybe because Syrio Forel was a smaller man than Ned? (You could say it's because being reduced to a pile of bones makes any man look small.) Where would Ned go during the War of the Five Kings? Why would he allow Robb to rally the North and get himself killed? Well Ned's injury was incredibly serious, even towards the end when he was in the Black Cells. He needs to recover. In Medieval times, it was a miracle for people to fully recover from a broken leg, especially in Ned's condition. He can't just get up and ride to the Twins to tell his son that he screwed up. He's probably in and out of a coma, a fever state only treated by Milk of the Poppy. Who would treat Ned, in secret, for almost a year? Who is isolated enough? Who loves Ned enough? That would be his old war buddy, the only other survivor of the events at the Tower of Joy, Howland Reed. The father of Jojen and Meera. Greywater Watch is said to be the most isolated, mysterious, and secretive fortress in the Seven Kingdoms. A floating wooden fortress in the Neck, surrounded by hundreds of miles of impassable bogs, swamps, and marshes? It's the perfect hiding place. Ned would be 75% recuperated around the time the events of Dance of Dragons start, roughly 18 months after his 'death' and roughly 2-6 months after he hears about the Red Wedding. At this point Ned would smuggle himself into Winterfell, just as the Boltons began to occupy it. Ned knows Winterfell better than Varys knows the Red Keep. Ned could hide in there for decades and no one would know. Ironically, he's probably just in the same place Bran and Rickon hid; the crypts. Anyway, I believe he's in Winterfell because of something that happens to Theon/Reek in Dance with Dragons. This Hooded Man accosts Theon, calling him Theon Turncloak, and Theon Kinslayer. Who would call Theon a Kinslayer? He had no part in any of the deaths in his family. Theon responds, ""I was Ironborn."" and the Hooded Man just says, ""False, is all you were."" It is widely rumored that good ol' honorable Ned Stark had cared for Theon as one of his kin, even though he was essentially a hostage. Ned basically raised him, and then Theon (allegedly) killed Bran and Rickon. Ned believes his two youngest sons are dead at the hands of this boy that he raised alongside them. That is the only reason why someone would call him Kinslayer, because no one else in the Seven Kingdoms thought of Theon as kin to the Starks. The next question, is why? Why would Varys want to keep Ned in the game? What possible reasoning does Varys have to keep him alive? It all boils down to the events in the east. Aegon Targaryen, or Aegon Blackfye aka the Mummer's Dragon. Varys reveals in book 5 that the recently revealed to be still alive (allegedly) is Aegon Targeryen, the son of Rhaeger and Elia Martell. Illyrio raised him in secret in Pentos, and he and Jon Connington, aka Old Griff, set out during Book 5 to first join with Daenerys, and then set out on their own to take Westeros. The return of the Targeryen throne, and it's all thanks to Varys. However, I also believe that Aegon is actually Illyrio's legitimate son, and he's the Mummer's Dragon, a vision Daenerys had in the house of the Undying. Aegon is actually a Blackfyre, and Illyrio is too. They are trying to right a wrong from hundreds of years ago. Anyway that's a story for a different day. Varys knows after the events of Book 1 that the Stark regime will fall, because without Ned the north will fall into chaos. Varys cannot rightly forsee the Bolton's taking over, but he knows the Starks are done. This is all due to the events preceding Robert's Rebellion. There are many families in the North who don't worship the Starks, and some that hate them. They are thrilled when the Stark dynasty is taken out. This is all because of one woman and her inability to marry Brandon Stark, and her father's hatred of being pulled into a bloody rebellion for no good reason. Lady Barbery Dustin reveals that her family, and some others, opposed Ned and Robert starting the war. Nothing was done, and they sat on their hatred for two decades. Now, the Bolton's are in charge, Stannis is basically defeated (maybe dead but I doubt it), and the North is relatively secure. What would happen if Ned came back? Chaos. Absolute chaos. The North would devolve into a civil war, just as winter is starting. Perfect time for a would be conqueror to come in and clean up the mess, wouldn't you say?"

0,Aww yeee the compliment sandwich.,"I will be lambasted for this comment as racist, but bear in mind that I make this distinction based on culture and not ethnic divisions (I. E. Does not apply to ethnically similar individuals raised in different environments.) I spend a huge amount of time with Chinese students. They are hands down the least innovative, least apt for leadership, and overall least caring for the welfare of Canada. They want their prestigious north American degree so they can land a top job back home. In large part they are the most non-interacting with other segments of student society. They keep to themselves, are the last person to strike up a friendly conversation with a stranger, they do not break ranks nor do they give two shits about what happens to BC. As someone in engineering sciences, they are generally the least interesting people to talk to. Not passionate for the ideas, not passionate to learn deeply, focused on grades and marks and resume building. The only more secluded and inward looking demographic would be south Koreans. Again, just in broad strokes, they are essentially a component of the student population which is non-interacting with the rest. Nonetheless these students regularly outperform vast swaths of everyone else when it comes to academics. Immigrants are generally the hardest working people in Canada, and Asian international students exemplify this very well. I have data to back this up for those interested. I'm making sweeping statements, and stereotypes, but they are accurate for the statistical majority. Tons of exceptions, yes. (Although honestly most Chinese innovators entrepreneurs seem to come from Hong Kong.) Whatever the case may be just don't delude yourself into thinking we are importing a class of dynamic, well rounded, entrepreneurial leaders who will embrace and integrate with Canadian culture. Again this has nothing to do with race, this has everything to do with the culture they were raised in, and whether it embraces individualism and diversity (it does not, although Hong Kong fares better here than other places). UBC hasn't become an attractive destination school for Asian countries because it offers the best chance to integrate with North America. It's earned this reputation because you can come here and form large groups of friends with culturally similar people, only reverting to English when dealing with university officials and professors. It's called chain migration and it happens for a host of reasons, the major one is the promise of cultural continuity with your homeland. I'll reiterate that these are probably the hardest working students at UBC by and large. But! And here is a massive caveat. Of all the engineering design clubs, team projects, student groups and Etcetera, a good deal are led by ethnically Asian peoples. But they were raised in North America or somewhere that inculcated a streak of individualism and dynamism. The only clubs I've seen (on imagine day) led by culturally Chinese/Korean students are specific to their nation, I. E. ""Korean students association"" or ""Chinese society for X"". Race has nothing to do with this. This is a cultural discussion purely. They are supremely hard working, intelligent, and respectful (probably more than average). But they are not dynamic leaders, do not embrace diversity, are not looking to ""assimilate"" into anyone else culture and are ultimately not invested in the long term welfare of BC. They may want to live and work here, because it offers opportunities. But if it starts to suck they'll just as easily pack up and go to Singapore, Australia, new Zealand, etcetera, or anywhere else where they can find a large established Chinese/Korean community to live a life that is politically liberal and Economically capitalist, but ultimately culturally Chinese/etc. Sorry for the rant. But this is something I face day in day out as a Vancouver born UBC student."
0,"Watching DS9 a few months ago, I thought it was rather amusing that the Cardassian's brutal labor camps are apparently based on the practice of making the Bajorans carry small baskets of rocks around.","So I was watching TNG last night, episode ""Ensign Ro"", which I *think* is the first episode featuring Bajorans. I thought it was really interesting, mainly because I had forgotten a lot about Star Trek and because I was a big fan of DS9. Observations: There's lots of talk about how the Federation is 'sympathetic' to the plight of the Bajorans, and how the diaspora is still oppressed on most of the worlds it reaches. But we also see signs that the Federation isn't... quite as sympathetic, or at least as understanding, as it could be in this situation - Starfleet officers are all unaware that Bajoran names have the familial name first, and Riker pretty aggressively demands that Ensign Ro remove her d'ja pagh, an important ethnic/religious symbol, and no one contradicts him on this. (Side note, is it weird that I actually felt really hurt when that happened, like as if I was watching actual bigotry? Because after all that DS9 in my youth I was absolutely shocked that a Starfleet officer would do something like that.) I like this from a worldbuilding angle - it's not like Starfleet humans are more evolved lifeforms, they just generally have their shit together re: tolerance/integration. They're still susceptible to all the usual human flaws when it comes to a people they don't understand, as tragic as that is... Second big observation is that Starfleet officers talk about how sad it is that Bajor is occupied and that Bajorans have ""lost their home"", but not that the Cardassians are strip mining the planet or committing widespread genocide. OOC I think this is just because the concept was just getting developed, but it's interesting to think of it like genocides today - unfortunately, it takes time to gather the information on what's happening, especially when states have incentives to not get involved in the first place, and it looks like that might've been the case to a degree in the earliest days of Federation involvement. They might not actually know the extent of Cardassian crimes. Interestingly, there's also a realistic divide in how this is discussed between officers and by Bajorans - again, captains and admirals quietly discuss how tragic it is that Bajorans have lost their home, etc, while Bajorans openly discuss widespread torture. Idk I just thought these were some interesting things that stood out to me in ""Ensign Ro"". I'm looking forward to binge watching everything that has to do with Bajorans now, so I can get back up to date on all this. edit also I'm still completely swamped by work, gotta wrap up this ten page paper then quickly do my five page + studying for the final this weekend. Life is going to be a lot better once summer happens."

0,Perhaps talk to your doc,"26m, I have a lot of emotional disturbance. I think it might be ADHD related? Any thoughts? I am 26 years old, male, I have my masters degree. When I was in high school, I was convinced I had ADHD because I couldn't concentrate in school. I would day dream, I would fantasize, I would doodle, I would draw things for several days (as opposed to just making shapes), I would sleep, I would talk, basically do anything besides work because I couldn't focus on it. My senior year I kind of accepted that it's not ADHD, but rather I just don't care. Back then I could sit and play a video game morning to night without any difficulty concentrating or getting caught up in side tasks. In college, while I did day dream, doodle, draw, etc, I was able to sit and pay attention at times. I could especially focus if I took notes, but if I just listened, I would end up day dreaming or doodling. Plus it was significantly easier to concentrate on subjects I cared about, but if it were something like math, biology, literature, and so on, I found myself side tracking a lot more. Now I am 26, and similar trends are showing up. When I talk to people, I can concentrate with ease in conversation, but when I speak to someone who makes long winded comments, my mind goes elsewhere. Also when I talk to people I'm comfortable with and I don't have a ""filter"" to be polite or respectful and I can just be myself, I try starting many conversations at once. I can talk to my girlfriend about her work day, then I talk about something I want to do about my motorcycle, then back to her work day, then weekend plans, then my work day, then about something from a video game, then back to her work day, etc. It's very rapid. I try to control it because I'm sure it's annoying and disrespectful. I have what feels like 80% control over what I say, but I can't control what I think about, sometimes it's so bad I realize I didn't listen to what the other person said. I can watch TV shows I enjoy like Breaking Bad for hours on end, but if it's a movie or show my girlfriend picks that I don't have interest in, I think about random things, I remember things I have to do, I get up and make sticky notes to do things later, or I noticed in the past year, sometime I just get so tired I fall asleep. Regardless of whether it's 3pm or 10pm, I drift off if I don't care. I have learned to control what I say and do to an extent, that isn't really that debilitating. The major problem is the emotional disturbance it causes. A lot of it manifests itself in depressive and anxious thinking styles. I feel like I have very very mild depression, primarily because of pathologically low self esteem, and just a slightly negative way of thinking but only about myself. About things in general or other people, I'm rather positive, but if it involves me, I'm not good enough, I deserve it, I'm bad because of this or that, everyone is better than me at everything, etc. People don't ever see this, I'm a really positive person, people like me because I'm always smiling and joking but in my head it's a mess sometimes. The anxious style thinking is the repetitive thinking and physical discomfort I get when I think about certain things that bother me. If I'm doing something, whether it's video games that I love or a TV show that bores me, my head repeats things that upset me as if I just can't ""drop the subject"" and think about something else. Sometimes it gets bad, where I cannot concentrate for at all, I change the subject in my head to what is bothering me, I change the subject verbally constantly, it gets to the point where it ruins days at a time. I wake up and I am still experiencing the negative mood and thinking from the day before. I know it's not bipolar because I'm never manic (or hypomanic) despite my hyperactive talking sometimes, and my depressive symptoms are very mild in my opinion. Last thing, is that I have always struggled with extreme anger. It's rather explosive, but it's not as bad as when I was a teenager. But I had a habit of engaging in verbal arguments over nothing, used to be in physical fights when I was a teenager, I get super impulsive and hit things (punched a hole in my garage wall a few weeks back). I have a very low frustration tolerance, and I get offended a little easy, so it's a bad combination. But again, I have control over it, I don't fight people anymore, I can go through a huge verbal argument without name calling or taking verbal low blows. But the anger is ongoing my entire life. To piggyback off the depressive and anxious thinking, when someone makes me mad, I brood about it for days. I get resentful, I don't let go for too long of a period of time compared to what I'd consider normal. I took St John's Wort for awhile to help with depressive symptoms. My girlfriend said I got better in terms of mood, but hate to say it, I couldn't get an erection. Went to the doctor and was prescribed Welbutrin. I'm not big on psychotropic medicine, especially because I wasn't sure if I needed it. But I took it, had a ridiculous amount of side effects but they slowly went away, and my girlfriend again said my mood got better. But after about 1.5-2 months, the positive effects starting wearing off, and I was just left with mild side effects. I stopped taking Welbutrin. That is my only medication I've ever been on. My question is do I have ADHD which causes emotional disturbance, or does my emotional disturbance cause ADHD symptoms? I want to feel normal. Would ADHD medication possibly help with all of these disturbances I'm experiencing and have experienced for most of my life? I know I can't get diagnosed here, but I want some opinions. My health insurance doesn't kick in until June, so I have time. Sorry for the giant wall of text, I figured all this is relevant information. If there's something more I can answer, please let me know. Thanks in advance!"

No sells to Reigns, makes himself look like a bad ass, does a REAL submission on Reigns that makes him tap and pulls a ""Montreal Screwjob"" on the WWE.

0,You can always buy the statue off of ebay.,"I can't decide So I'm buying a NEW 3DS XL. I mainly wanted the Majoras mask edition, but its sold out everywherel. So I got my second choice, the MH4U N3DSXL witch I preordered yesterday. (btw MH4U is the biggest reason I'm getting a N3DS) Then I see an advertising from an online store, that they are getting the new skull kid figure. But its pagaked whit a normal New 3DS (not XL) and now I can't decide witch one I want. I mainly want an XL but I also think the normal is sweet whit the faceplates and the colored buttons, plus I'm I huge sucker for statues an figurines. But its 89 dollars more expensive. I also love Monster hunter and it is the game I'm looking the most forward to, But Majoras mask is my favorite Zelda game. I also think the statue has a little more value since it won't age, no matter how many new Nintendos that's coming in the future, the skull kid will still look cool on my shelf. While the MH4U 3DS XL will be easily forgotten after some years Since the N3DS one day will be outdated. The MH4U 3DS XL (game pre instaled) is 295 usd (2300 norwegian krones) The N3DS + skull kid + Majoras mask is 370 usd (2890 norwegian krones) So yeah, just want to hear your guys opinion, and what you would get/are getting?

They are much more uncomfortable with banning abortion in cases of rape and incest than the Catholic Church is, and this has always been the case. It's not a matter of moving goalposts, it's always been then case. If I correctly recall, even President Reagan and both Pres. G.H.W. Bush and Pres. G.W. Bush wanted rape and incest and life of the mother exceptions in pro-life bills. Rep. Henry Hyde ended up having to add rape, incest, and life of the mother exceptions to the Hyde Amendment back when it was passed in the late 1970s or early 1980s. The culture is definitely moving in a pro-life direction with regards to abortion, however, and fortunately the ""post-birth abortion"" concept is something currently confined to a few nutty academics like Peter Singer and hasn't caught on in the mainstream culture, but we need to ensure that it never catches on."

I think he saw the chance to influence middle east politics as the leader of islam in the region with supporting palestine no matter what against israel. It was also an opportunity to gain more support for elections because there was already much sympatyh among the turkish people for palestine.

There are a few reasons for that, one of which is that many guys are at various stages of appeal and bragging about what you did can expose yourself to potential issues in that appeal. Another reason is, you never know who knew your victims, so bragging isn't a good idea. Also, most of these guys aren't exactly proud of getting busted and sent to prison, so there isn't much to brag about. On the flip side, crimes against children are certainly looked down upon by the general population, but most of the tree jumpers are kept locked up with other tree jumpers so there aren't a lot of opportunities for ""prison justice"" on them."

0,Stand up for yourself young hu-man!,"TIFU by bringing the wrong presents to a party This happened the other night at a dinner party at my girlfriend's friend's apartment. **The Before** Recently my girlfriend and I have been talking about getting back into shape (I had been playing Ultimate Frisbee for several years and recently had to stop due to too much schoolwork, and my girlfriend just wanted to get more active), so I decided I should get us Fitbits for Christmas. I was rather excited, ordered them on Amazon a week before the party (thank you Amazon Prime!), and waited to exchange the presents. Well, I couldn't wait any longer, and since my girlfriend and I aren't going to see each other on Christmas, due to attending our respective family's festivities, I figured I would bring them along and exchange them at the party! The host of the party said there were ""presents under the tree for us"", so I figured it would be a good time to do it. **The During** Now my girlfriend didn't know about the gifts and I wanted it to be a surprise, so I wrapped them up - without labels - and brought the along with a bottle of wine to the dinner. I tucked the presents under the tree, unannounced, and we continued to have a wonderful meal. Later in the evening we exchange presents, and I think you can see where I'm going with this. Now, I can get a bit socially awkward at parties if I'm not really close to everyone there - which I wasn't. The host's wife starts pulling presents from under the tree and sees my two gifts. She asks who's they are, I answer they were mine, and before I could say anything she goes ""Oh, these must be for us!"" and they start opening the presents.... They seemed very excited....... **The After** I now am out two fitbits (one for myself, and one for my girlfriend), my girlfriend is now mad at me because I ruined the surprise, and now I won't be able to order new ones in time for Christmas... **The TL;DR** Brought unlabeled gifts to a dinner party, intended for my girlfriend and I, the hosts thought there were for them and opened the presents. I have now ruined Christmas."

0,This is something to think about for a second,"I'm dissapointed that their Featured Artists are the ones which are the most popular on the label, not the ones who regularly release for a long period of time, because these ""regulars"" are what actually represents Monstercat. Like I understand featuring only the most popular artists which released with them for a long time ala PBN, Tristam, Varien etc., but when you bring in a brand new artist (which is also already well established by themselves ala Sound Remedy and San Holo) and plop 'em onto that Featured Artist list, it just seems really unfair to artists like Direct, MrFijiWiji, Droptek, Tut Tut Child, Bustre etc. who are actually the soul and foundation of this label's repertoire. Don't even get me started on Krewella being there. Yes, I get they brought them into the light of the scene and they blew up and they hang onto that old glory because it was their first, and really only, major success, but if they're gonna hang on to old artists, why remove from their roster the artists which haven't released this year? Now I understand why they do all of this, to show off the label's success' so they can compete against the top tier labels, but it honestly feels just somehow wrong. If I were among the artists who worked with them for years and didn't get featured just because my releases weren't popular enough, I'd feel sort of used. If they're going to care about the biggest artists only (care as in actively try to put the spotlight onto them and improve their career), why would I even bother with such a label? Like, they're a great start to kind of establish yourself, but I feel most of their artists won't get further than that, not because their music isn't good enough, but because they are purposely overshadowed."

Economic sanctions are generally imposed in an effort to pressure a government we oppose to change some aspect of its regime. In the case of Cuba, it was Communism and human rights violations. But the embargo didn't cause the regime to crumble like we'd hoped, and it didn't end up changing their behavior significantly. It just affected Cubans, who suffered financially and in some cases died because of trade restrictions on important things like medication. Anyway, the whole world kept trading with them and we're finally giving up on the whole thing."

With that being said, i think we should draft the best lineman available, regardless of their actual position, and stick them at left guard. The cowboys did it with Zack Martin (college LT, NFL RG) and it worked out really well for them. Ramon Foster wasn't terrible this year but he's getting old and his time is coming soon enough. Plus it wouldn't hurt to actually have depth on the Oline. While I'm sure a lot of people are thinking corner back, I'm not entirely sold that we need to use a 1st rounder on one.

The fact is, the only thing this laptop does better than other laptops in this price range is battery life, and fails miserably on other specs. If you are willing to pay 2-3 times more for the same performance just to get a few more hours of battery life, then go for it, but most people would not make this choice. My guess is most people will buy this thinking it will have good performance because it is a macbook, without actually knowing what the specs are."

As you know XBOX has standards which have to be met when using their Live network. They very much want a service which is consistent and delivers quality. For instance, if you have a friend logon to XBOX Live come online they want to make sure you are notified about it. For this reason, many of the features that are expected to be working for their services overlapped with what are normal services for ESO on the PC. Friends list, ignore lists, muting, etc. all had counterparts active on our service. If you ignored someone in our game, it was expected that you meant to ignore them on the XBOX live service. So originally we had some places where we needed to show you a XBOX gamertag to be compliant, but otherwise you could see a character name. Even though this was possible, through testing, it became very confusing. It was also a very complex thing to keep implemented on our end, sometimes requiring a doubling up of code for what was essentially duplicated functionality. In order to eliminate the confusion for our players and reduce points of failure due to the complexity of the system we chose to simply show the XBOX gamertags. Though it does, admittedly, hurt some of the roleplaying and immersion elements, the social benefits and clarity made this decision the one we chose."

I replied and we set up a time to meet nearby with my husband and new puppy. We spent a couple of hours with him, letting him take whatever photos he wanted. At the end of the session he said that his normal turn around time is a couple of weeks. After not hearing from him for about 8 weeks I follow up by email. He finally got back to me after about 3 months from the shoot and said that he will be delivering the images soon. It has been 2 more months and still nothing. I've followed up again, but I don't know what to do. He is using the photos on his website (as I agreed that he could), but he has not sent me the photos (as he agreed he would). I've emailed him and said that all I would like is the unedited photos (so he doesn't need to spend additional time on them if he doesn't want to) and I have offered to pay him for the photos (from the beginning I was planning on tipping him upon receiving the photos).

0,Why people are so against damage i cant understand ...,"The point would be explicitly that zerkers could *not* blow everything up in a single rotation, they could dance in, do heavy damage, and then get out, not nuke it down immediately. In my best-case scenario, Celestial (and other mixed off/def sets) would be far from useful, they would have much better sustain, but still have to dode big telegraphed attacks. In my scenario, if a team went full zerker, they would jump in, burst everything, realize that everything isn't dead yet, run out and everyone would spend some time doing very little damage, kiting around, using healing skills, before they could get in the thick of it to burst again."

If Amumu has 40% CDR his stun has a mere 4.8s CD (8s base CD) while stunning for one second. His ultimate is a lot more reliable, and his overall damage output both in terms of clearspeed as well as in teamfights is better than that of Sejuani. Hitting Amumu's Bandage is also surprisingly easy. It's essentially as easy as hitting Lee Sin's Q (identical range, similar projectile speed). I think the primary reason he's not played is because any jungler will shit on him. He's fast at clearing and good at ganking, but he's a terrible duelist, and as thus will easily be pushed out."

Why is Greninja, Mega Lucario, Mega Kangskhan, Mega Mawile, Mega Mence Uber? Kangskhan is one that I actually believe is overpowered, just the sheer power of its double edge. Greninja and Lucario are still glass cannons and are easily revenged killed. Zapdos is a notable Lucario check since he resists both of Lucario's STABs and can KO back with HeatWave. Ferrothorn and Slyveon are great Greninja checks and KO back with their respective STAB attacks. Mega-Mawile is definitely not uber. Since the popularity of Heatran. Heatran is like the perfect counter to it. As Mawile doesn't get earthquake, Heatran pretty resists all of Mawile's main moves and can threaten with a fire move. Thank you!"

0,I thought this was a serious question?,"Serious question about Anarcho-Capitalism Suppose in an Anarcho-Capitalist world, one family starts buying up land. They rent out most of it, but never sell. The entire fortune is always passed down to one heir. If a plot of land is not available for sale without conditions, they simply wait till it is. Time is not an issue. They can wait several generations till whoever then owns it is willing to sell. They spend substantially less than what they earn through rental and never incur any debts. over a period of, say, 10,000 years, through the power of compounded earnings, they manage to acquire every scrap of land on Earth. The heir then declares himself to be a God-king and demands that everyone who lives on his land worship him as a condition for living there. He bans the construction of space shuttles and any related research on his land, essentially trapping everyone and making them practically slaves. Would this still be Anarcho-Capitalist, or have I understood it wrong?"

Honestly using a text editor for python should be fine, I'm not doing things like tracking artifacts or garbage collection, or tracking builds with something like Maven or Ant, so the added overhead of a fully fledged IDE just isn't worth it to me. ST helped me keep it simple, it stays out of the way while I get to code. Now, I've only used this on projects that are probably less than 10k lines of code, and don't really have an opinion on the best way to manage larger projects, but even in that case I could see ST being good enough if the code isn't simply atrocious and poorly arranged in its project structure"

0,"Once they realized this ""we admit that this is a huge generalization"" they should have just not done this article.","Personally, I feel like it's the fans of K Beauty that are overreacting. Nowhere in that article does she say that Korean/Asian beauty products and techniques are bad; she says that they, like everywhere else in the world, have good ones and bad ones. She attributes the better skin of asian/Korean people (whether perceived or otherwise) to being more willing to spend the time and money on a proper skincare routine, including sunblock, moisturizers, etc. I do feel she's making some broader generalizations than she should be, such as that 40 minute routine every night bit, but I don't see what there is to be outright upset about. To quote the last line in summary, ""Regardless of where the products are sold or made, there are good and bad products all over the world. In summary, shopping Korean brands exclusively is no more a guarantee of better skin or more attractive makeup than shopping at a Korean grocery store is a guarantee of healthier food."""

0,I use smurf accounts for that...,"I feel hopeless as a one trick pony. How do people evolve? I can play Singed reasonably well, and I think that's fair to say given how I've climbed this season from Silver V to Gold II with him alone. That's nice and all, but after 400 or so games with him, he gets so boring even when you are kicking ass and taking names. It doesn't feel special anymore. Yet it seems aside from Singed, I absolutely can't play any other Champion as expected of a upper Gold player. I can play Sona, Soraka, and Nami, but nowhere near as good as Singed. I've tried champions people consider braindead like Teemo, Vladimir, and Malphite, but still fuck up like some low Silver player when piloting any of them. There's also the issue I can't jungle, which is more of a concern to me than not ADCing. I desperately want to learn how to play Evelynn for example, but there's nowhere to start on for me. I simply can't risk learning JG in ranked (incurring the wrath of others), and don't want to deal with normals. It's made worse while I do put up admirable efforts as Singed even now, the Champion's weaknesses are surely catching up to me now and I feel overwhelmed. But I'm ""still leashed"" to playing Singed for success...and I don't know what to do anymore."

I don't quite remember which episode ut was, but Fry is challenged by Zoidburg to a fight to the death, and when they get into the fight, Zoidburg was bloodlusted. Zoidburg actually has had military training, albeit most likely minimal, but Zoidburgs claws have no difficulty cutting through things like flesh, bone, and steel when he wants them to. Though despite all this, Fry seems to hold the upper hand during the entire fight, even after having his arm severed. If he wanted to, Fry could have easily killed Zoidburg, someone much more dangerous then G1 Ash. So if Fry could beat a bloodlusted Decapoidian, he could probably beat a ten year old kid."

This makes the code much more readable, even without comments. For example, if you have a function called ""login"", it would look something like this: function login() { username = getUsername(); password = getPassword(); if (isValidLogin(username, password)) { setIsLoggedIn(); } else { createInvalidPasswordMessage(); } } And not something like: function login() { username = getUsername(); password = request.params.password; if (hash(password) == dbUsers.find('password').where('username', username)) { session.set('is_logged_in', true); } else { createInvalidPasswordMessage(); } } The other thing I like to do is guard conditions rather than nested ifs.

When Bret screwed Bret in Montreal the issues that Vince and co. had were moral, like ""are we doing the right thing?"" Michaels on a podcast recently said that once they decided they were going to screw Bret all they needed to do was coordinate when they were going to pull the trigger. Brett was a legit tough guy, but he wasn't Brock Lesnar. Should Brock decide that he's not going to put over Reigns, theirs not much Roman can do about it. Brock is one of the all time great shoot fighters off all time who once almost through Kurt Angle off a plane. Roman is... well, he played football and he's Samoan. So here's the puzzle for you to solve. You're Vince in gorilla at Wrestlemania and you realize that Brock is shooting. You don't want him leaving with the belt, and simply telling one of the ring announcers to grab the belt and walk up the ramp isn't good enough. You need to have Brock look at least somewhat vonerable, even if when the truth gets out later that night, he's going to be one of the biggest badasses ever. My idea was to send Big Show and Jack Swagger (I think he was a NCAA wrestler) down, and have them hold Brock down like he's getting arrested, and than quick count Rollins and than everyone runs like hell. I'm not saying Brock will go into buiesness for himself, he'd walk out before he did that. But, if you had do, who would you send out? A respected legend? Another shoot fighter? Or do you try some other trickery and hope Brock doesn't catch on."

0,Alright :) just try playing at above your refresh rate and then try to tell me there is no difference :),"Let me break this down into an analogy: Imagine a monk is sitting in his study with a chalkboard behind him. On his desk in front of him sits a stack of papers. An altar boy sits on the other side of the desk, writes a number on a piece of paper, and then places that paper on top of the stack, before writing another number on another piece of paper, and again putting it on top of the stack. The altar boy keeps doing this over and over, allowing the stack of papers to pile up. Meanwhile, next to the stack of papers is a sort of metronome. Every time it ""dings"", the monk stands up, looks at the TOP-most piece of paper on the stack on his desk, goes to the blackboard, erases what's currently there, and writes down whatever was written on that piece of paper. The number on the blackboard stays there until the metronome ""dings"" again, and once again the monk stands up, reads from the TOP-most piece of paper on the stack, and writes the number on the board. The monk and the altar boy each work at their own pace, with the monk being governed by how quickly the metronome dings, and the altar boy being governed only by how fast he can write down new numbers. The altar boy is the video card. The monk and his blackboard are the monitor. The metronome is the refresh rate. So, a couple of exercise questions that I want you to think about and answer: 1) Imagine that the altar boy was replaced by a hyper-caffeinated mathematician who can write down numbers and get new pieces of paper to write on a *lot* faster. If nothing else changes (i.e. the metronome or the monk), what difference will it make to what's written on the blackboard? 2) Imagine that the altar boy stays the same, but now the metronome is replaced by a much faster one that dings at a faster rate, faster than the altar boy can write down new numbers. It dings twice for every time the altar boy adds a new piece of paper to the top of the stack What is the monk writing down on the blackboard every time he gets up with each ""ding""?"

Question about what drives product popularity, not purchase advice (I already know exactly what my next purchase will be, and why). From what I can gather from reviews, it appears that the AD900x is at least on par with, if not preferred over other popular open headphones (all more expensive), but falls way behind those same compared headphones in terms of popularity. Why is this? My first thought is that it's merely differences/preferences in sound signature that are important enough to so many consumers that they are wiling to spend much more to chase them. But I remember my first statement about the results of my reviews research...often, if not usually, AD900x's being preferred to their compared competition. So, I question other factors. Are those people publishing reviewers a minority when compared to the general headphone consumers, thereby not representative and predictive of the greater population. Is it marketing sex appeal? Would they get more love if they cost 475$, instead of less than 150$(currently on Amazon). Is it more related to over-all brand marketing, and not as much on the specific product? I live in a headphone consumer wasteland and have not ventured into the open side of headphones yet, so I have no opinions of my own, thus why I ask about the venerable redditnation."

0,I've never seen a thor auto target an overlord over an ultralisk,"Dear Blizzard, can we do something about the Thor autotargeting? I know some of you might say this is a post for r/allthingsterran but I really think this is an issue that can be easily addressed. Awhile back when blizzard made thors auto target air units it was nice, but it could be improved. Example: When playing mech against zerg there are times when you need thors to target ground units (mainly ultras). However, some zergs know how the thor targeting works and they will hold position overlords above the thors and laugh while the thors shoot the overlords and the Terran army dies. Therefore, I ask that we have a button that selects thors to prioritize air or ground units. This wouldn't be hard and I don't think it's a lot to ask for. What do you guys think?"

He hasn't done it now for almost 4 years.The last 3 years and 10 months he's been faithful and he doesn't seem to get those feelings to be with guys anymore. I know for a fact he's been faithful since then. I love him I mean I really do LOVE him. Even If I tried I could never stop loving him and he was always there for me. Should I break up with him?? I mean that would be the headrest thing in the world for me to do but idk? Should I tell I know he cheated or let it go? I feel like if I don't say anything then he got away with it cause he thinks I don't know but idk. Wouldn't that mean he got away with it? Does this mean he doesn't love me?"

The concept of Islam is unique to each person that considers themselves Muslim. Each Muslim views the tenets of Islam in a slightly or very different way. People are the problem. And there's no good solution. And people are also lazy and want a quick fix. What's the quick fix? Blanket statements, like ""Islam is horrible"".

I did and we talked for awhile and she was pretty distraught about 'the truth' and the elders, etc. She said that it really bothered her that for years people would question whether she was really annointed and it made her wonder if she was being prideful and partaking when she shouldn't. She struggled with this for years and had even tried not partaking a couple years to see if she would more clearly see Jehovah's hand in her life. She said she felt unworthy and unlovable by Jehovah and his people. An elder and his wife came to see her the other day to see if she was going to the memorial but when she said she couldn't physically go they did not offer to bring her the emblems afterward. In fact for the last 3 years the elders have not brought the emblems to her. When she told them she couldn't afford the wine this year and had no way to get it anyway they didn't say anything. She was sobbing, body wrenching sobs when she said this stuff. I held it together while I was with her but I was so pissed off. There they all are tonight in their finest clothes stressing that this is the most important day of the year, a most solemn occasion and here is a woman who truly believes in her heart that she is going to be one of Christ's brothers ruling in heaven, a party to the new covenant they are celebrating and they are leaving her spiritually hungry and thirsty tonight (you know the scripture - whoever does this to the least of my brothers...). But they are all sitting in their KH right now passing the bread and the wine oh so carefully from one person to another and one after another no one eats or drinks all while the only one in the congregation whose spirit has heard it directly from God's that she should partake they've left out of the party!! So this afternoon a so-called apostate bought kosher wine, tasteless Jewish crackers and pretty flowers so she could do her thing in her own home, just her and God. Shame on them all."

0,I hope you start to see how hard he is using you,"And another bomb was dropped on my marriage... Hi folks, I am really in need of some advice and guidance before this evening. Last night my SO had therapy. He came home and things were good, headed to bed later than normal, but I gave him a sensual blow job for an hour, then we snuggled for a bit, and he wanted to talk. He said that his therapist had recommended that he and I plan alone time, because we don't have any time normally that we just do our own thing. I love this idea and have been asking for it for a few years, just because there are movies he won't see, activities he won't do (I'm an avid bowler!) And other things I'd just like the time to do without him getting upset. So, awesome. He said one night a week we both go and do whatever we want to, no questions asked, anything so long as it doesnt hurt ""us"". In my mind this meant exactly what I just described. Alone time to have some hobbies and whatnot that are separate from the marriage. What *he* meant was that he was opening the marriage. I found this out when he told me about the man he was going to be with and the girl (who he cheated with a few years ago) he was going to hang out with. What.the.fuck. So I told him that I think he and I have differing opinions on what hurts ""us"", and that we need to establish that before this can be a thing. He ""graciously"" said that he is totally fine with me being with a woman, but that he would be hurt if I did anything with a man. I stopped him and told him very clearly that I'm not interested in women or other men. He then said ""I know."" And proceeded to explain why he wanted this, despite all the strides we have made to resurrect our DB, despite him saying that the sex was satisfying, despite my desperate attempts to make him happy. He said I was too vanilla and that he needed to dominate and be dominated. He said when I tie him up, I don't whip him hard enough, and because I can't handle being tied up, he feels that doing that sort of a thing is one of his basic needs, and that I'm not fulfilling it. I don't know what to do. We are continuing the conversation tonight. I'm just so hurt. I don't know how to express to him that this hurts me, and I can't figure out if I'm wrong to be hurting. He has these needs... am I abusive for not letting him get them elsewhere? I hate this. I hate how every time I start enjoying sex with him he pushes just a little bit more until I feel anxious again. How can I have sex with him if he's having sex with others? I'm terrified of disease. there's no sure fire ways to prevent them entirely Unless he is super thorough about the people he's doing it with... but I don't even like the idea of that. I don't know. I need to come back to the conversation tonight with my feelings in understandable words. Right now I can't figure what those words even are. Help?"

Before anyone jumps on me saying that valve should upgrade their GOTV configs to higher tickrates, think about this: MM GOTV is public and they run on Valves own server machines. Anyone can watch anyone's game. Higher tickrate GOTV requires a lot more processing power for those machines, and if Valve were to update their GOTV configs to let's say 64 tick, they would probably have to triple the amount of machines that run the servers. Also while this is already possible due to GOTV being public, higher tickrate would make it much easier for attackers to lag out servers, as they already have to work on a higher load for just a single client watching."

0,"Maybe not at lower levels of play, but skilled players have such solid defense you almost always have to start a combo with a well-timed jab or short string because anything more powerful has such a long startup you're just going to get stuffed over and over and over.","I'm gonna nitpick here and say that lack of execution doesn't really bar you from frametraps and setups. Setups are scored usually after knockdowns making them accessible to anyone who can land a sweep or something and don't require strict execution. Additionally, you can practice setups in training mode so that you can perform them when the time comes. Frametraps and counterhit setups aren't so much about execution as much as they are about timing and reads. Execution comes in after scoring the hit but that's about it. You can definitely learn a lot of higher level concepts without good execution at first with a good amount of the cast. It would definitely help the newer player that immediately goes in trying to play characters like Viper or Abel to have this input leniency so I can't argue there. But I think execution in general doesn't really play as big of a part or affect strategy as much as I perceive you saying. At least for most of the cast."

0,My wife pays way more than the auto payment and the auto payment still comes on the same day each month.,"Student Loans setup to prevent me from paying faster. Other millennials stuck w/ ""Navient""? Hello! I've had my student loans on auto-pilot for years, auto-deducting the minimum of $265 from my bank account each month. I've just gotten a new job, and I'm ready to hit them harder and pay at least $500/mo towards my balance of ~$20,000 spread across 10 federal loans I took out throughout my undergraduate degree. Last year, Sallie Mae transferred my loans to ""Navient"", and the tools for managing my loans are a joke. If I pay extra on top of my regular auto-deduction, I noticed they moved my next auto-deduction date back to keep me ""on schedule"" for my 10 year plan. They're also automatically allocating ""on my behalf"" how to split my payment amongst the 10 loans which each have different interest rates and balances. The customer service rep said if I'd like to choose how to allocate my payment or pay more than the auto-deduct rate, I can stop paying online, and pay by check each month with a hand written letter detailing how much of my payment is to go to each loans' account number. This all just seems ridiculous. They're clearly gaming me by making it difficult to pay faster or smarter by limiting the tools available on their website, setting up hoops to jump through. The rates are quite low, and I'm not sure I can consolidate into a better rate, but I'm generally just irritated at the game. Any advice on how to kill these things?

She knows for first hand experience that the teacher's union defends just plain bad teachers, even those accused of student molestation. Those things are what destroy education but the union could care less about quality education, just force the school system to retain teachers who should be fired for the sake of the students."

You have ownership of your unit (deeded title to your unit), which has a restrictive covenant requiring membership in the condo association and adherence to the rules the condo association establishes. The analogy to your interpretation of what I'm saying would be like claiming you can't own a home in a gated community because it has an HOA. Wrong. You own the home, and part of the deed requires you to be a member of the HOA, which owns the common land. So you own the your parcel in the community, and as a necessity of this you own a share in the organization that owns the common property. Does that make sense to you?"
0,I think agile web development with rails 4 is a good low level book on how to use rails with ruby to make websites.,"Learn Ruby in a practical manner?

For instance, I'm learning about strings, arrays and hashes using this website, but it's only teaching me about them to a certain level, I'd love it if they showed me a part of a website and then showed how me how strings, hashes and arrays would play into that part of the website.

Despite the massive anvances in graphics for me it feels like there was a golden age of pc gaming. Sure there have been fair share of games that have been released since then which are outstanding, but when I play some of the classics (e.g Baldur's gate, AoE, Empire Earth, Thief, Half Life, Diablo, Deus Ex, RCT, carmageddon, Diablo 2 and others) there seems to be so much more substance to the games in general which I can't quite put my finger on. They just feel less empty then modern games and so much more immersive and unique. Does anyone else agree and if so why do you think the quality of games has declined?"

By now you're a high ranking executive in Germany and you hop on the Auto-Bahnter and you try to hold back your road rage. You relies that you can do this by using banter. You shout at people- calling then horrific names and they look at you in shock. They haven't heard banter in years, not since Eric Bantana bought Real Madrids stadium in 2020- The Santiago Banterbau. They all join in the banter and soon they're all acting like children. The banter gets out of control and the police get involved. This is Germany by the way and these are Banti-fun and pro-Work. Your boss is informed of your arrest and you're fired. You head back to your home town of Banterbry and you decided to pick up the boots. You decide that you'll be the one to bring Banter back.

0,You may also want to look back and see if there was a late 4th quarter payment (from 2013) paid in early 2014.,"Real Estate Tax Question This year my mortgage was sold from one mortgage company to another. As I was putting my 2014 taxes together, I noticed my real estate taxes paid from the original mortgage company was about half the amount of last year (meaning they paid only one of the two installments). The tax form from the new mortgage company listed $0 paid in taxes in 2014. So I went onto our town's public tax records and realized that they paid the second installment, which was due on 1/1/15, nearly a month late. So they technically paid it in 2015. Though my taxes are built into my mortgage payment and put into escrow, it appears I can only claim the first installment, correct? If so, what happens next year? Could I possibly claim 3 payments if they actually pay 2015 both installments in time?"

The three middle aged divorcees had met in group therapy months before, becoming friends outside of therapy. They would meet and play poker and discuss how their wives ""screwed them out of everything"" always over beer. This evening, they would meet at ""Beer Me"" Bill's house, a burly construction foreman for a small concrete laying company. The house was an old brownstone type, plaster walls and old, creaking hardwood floors. Mike and Gus had wondered how Bill had managed to keep his house after the breakup, but it seemed a touchy subject, so they never asked. As the night went on, the beer began to lose its appeal, and Gus had lost all his money, and the mood sank. Mike decided to liven up the crowd with an ex-wife joke; ""You know, guys, when me and my ex were in the middle of splitting up, I once told he that sometimes I felt like killing her. She told me I needed proffessional help. So I started looking for a hitman"", he said. It had worked. Gus and Bill had erupted in laughter, Bill nearly spilling his beer. Not letting the momentum fall, Gus chimed in,"" What do you do if you still miss your ex? Take shooting lessons!"" Again, Bill nearly spilled his beer. It was now Bills turn. ""Whats black and blue, lives in my basement, and hates having sex with me?"" he said. ""My ex wife Charlotte!"" This time, Bill did spill his beer as they all burst into hysterical laughter. Charlotte stopped peering up through the crack, quietly wiping the beer from her eye."

I prepped with gloves, put him in the bath, but forgot the whole cover his arsehole with toilet paper part. He was surprisingly docile during it, mildly curious but that's about it. At first I couldn't find the glands, so I was pretty much just milking his arsehole, but then I found those little pea sized balls of fury. It was like Psycho or something, anal gland juice sprayed all up the walls and everything. Holy mackeral does that stuff smell bad! I vaguely knew, from his leaky butt earlier, but it was nothing compared this crime scene. My dog immediately turned around and started trying to lick it all up, to hide his shame, I imagine, but I managed to stop him before he got through too much of it.

So I was thinking about the reasoning behind the toxicity that players have in regards to League and I think that the biggest reason that players become toxic is because they take the game seriously and believe that they are not at the rank/level that they believe they should be at. If this is true, I think the biggest deterrent for toxic behavior would be to demote the player a division as well as the bans / chat restriction that Riot gives out. For example, suppose a player needs ""x"" amount of reports in ""y"" amount of time before Riot would give out a chat restriction / ban. When the player meets these criteria, what if Riot also demoted them 1 division. If the player is a repeat offender the number of divisions demoted increases. As touched on earlier, this stems from the belief that the vast majority of toxic players are toxic because A) they take the game very seriously B) feel they aren't high enough ranked for their skill level. If A and B are true, the biggest way to punish the individual player is to de rank them. **tl;dr Toxic players care a lot about the game and their rank in it, so the best way to discourage toxic behavior would be to derank toxic players. This would teach them to not be toxic if they wanted a shot to climb solo Q**"

People were saying I hacked, asking if I would trade skins, etc. We we're losing 4-11 at end of half. 2nd half we started bad. I'm almost certain their top fragger (4 1/2 hours played) was walling. The last round I played was a 1 v 4 site retake at A. I immediately killed both smurfs at Z connecter. Couple seconds later, my player froze with an auto disconnect message. Tried to reconnect, says I'm not logged on Steam. I close my game. My windows Taskbar is showing an exclamation point. I look at my modem, all the light are off. My internet was totally shut down. Like someone hit a kill switch. Was wondering what other people think? I've read people can obtain your IP address from you Steam community profile. And they were definitely looking at my profile a lot, commenting on my skins. I find it plausible some angry nerd trying to smurf his way up ranks might want to eliminate threats with pocketing tools. What makes me think it's not DDoS though is when I see pro players get DDosed on stream, their ping goes up to like 900. Mine did no that, my internet just went offline.

0,Completely with you on this.,"The average woman will likely not be taller than the average guy, but I do expect the height gap to close. Estrogen causes the epiphyseal plates to close, ending height growth. This is why girls stop growing at a younger age - they have more estrogen. Now, a couple factors are in play which may cause boys to produce more estrogen and hence grow less. One is the chemicals from industrial processes and plastics, like BPA. These chemicals are prevalent in the products we use and even our air and water, and may contribute to higher estrogen levels in boys. Another is the fact that fat converts testosterone into estrogen, and hence if the average bf% of boys goes up, so does their estrogen levels. Judging by rising obesity rates, I expect this is a significant factor. Guys will still have less estrogen than girls, but the difference may well be shrinking - just like their height."

I'm not asking for everyone to go hollow or insane as they fall into the depths of despair, but some sort of closure would be nice, instead of everyone just sitting around doing nothing.

0,Awesome kid.,"""Oh MY GAWD!"" I don't work retail anymore, but I do volunteer once a week at a free store, which is basically like working at a clothing store, except without getting paid. I know there are a lot of horror stories on here about little monsters, and I just wanted to share a different kind of kid story. We had a little guy walk in today, and as he marched past our table towards the kids section, he cheerfully called out ""Hi!"" We said hi back, already grinning from how cute he was. But then he hit the toy section, and his little mind just exploded. ""Oh MY GAWD!"" he cried, grabbing a football and running back over to our table. ""It's a football!"" He threw it in his mom's basket, and ran back into the toy section. Five seconds later ""Oh MY GAWD!"" He had found another football. Three second after that ""Oh MY GAWD!"" at plastic toy farm. Every couple of seconds, as he discovered some new treasure, he would shout another ""Oh MY GAWD!"" with delight. The experience was extra hilarious because the free store is located in a church, and I'm sure some of the older volunteers were less than thrilled to hear a toddler loudly taking the Lord's name in vain every couple of seconds. But it was just *so* cute. Finally, he brought over a couple of blocks over and proudly pointed out that one was a rectangle and one was a square. After we affirmed that he was right, he traipsed away, loudly wondering if there were any triangle blocks, and proudly stating that ""a triangle has...FOUR sides!"" It was just too funny to watch the little guy loudly and enthusiastically discover all the treasures hidden in our toy section, and it made all of our days a little better."

He also used to beat her mother pretty badly. They were tenant farmers, my grandmothers job was to go into the swamp at dusk and bring their few cows back to the house. Sounds not too bad, except for the fact that the swamp was full of snakes and she was nearly bitten a number of times.

Just trying to do some fun predictions for the upcoming MLG tournament in Columbus, Ohio. Here are my power rankings: 1. EG 2. NoT Today 3. Team Empire 4. NiP 5. BBC 6. MVP Phoenix Honestly I thought Rave could take third, but with this new addition of MVP Phoenix I don't think they are bad, just everyone else is amazing. BBC has some great players in W33haa (with his aggressive play style) and Levi (amazing support rotations saving teammates) but can they make the next step from tier 2 team to tier 1? I don't think they will this time around. NiP and Empire are neck and neck and even with Era playing amazing as he has of late, I think NiP will lose out to Empire. If Empire had their full roster (Yoky isn't going to MLG funn1k is) I'd say they would get first or second. Now this brings me to the dark horse of this tournament and I think this is the next step for South American DotA. Smash and company will do amazing things at this LAN. With NoT Today playing on even ping I think they can acquire second or third place. I really want to see them take the next step to tier 1 status. I hope they succeed and do well. EG is a safe bet and normally I don't like taking the safe bet but with Universe still playing out of his mind and with ppd still drafting like a genius, there is little enemy teams can do to stop them. This is a big step for BBC, MVP Phoenix, and NoT Today. if they come in first or second they might get a direct invite to ti5(or honorable mentions) so this tournament has a lot of pressure on these teams. I see EG, NiP, and Empire all getting direct invites to ti5."

0,What other way of ruining a person's day is there than killing them or destroying their ship?,"CIG made their intentions clear when they involved PVP on a single server PU. This is ostensibly a pvp server. They are not offering pve servers to work alongside this. The argument I see over and over is that an AI might kill them but the AI won't purposefully fuck with them or troll them. So basically what's going on here is the pve segment that seems to be anti-pvp (not all pve players are anti-pvp) does not actually have a problem with pvp they have a problem with griefers. So then the issue isn't with pvp, the issue is with toxic behaviour. This is a problem that we can solve, CIG just needs to create a reliable way of reporting and punishing toxic behaviour. The funny thing is they act like some how the hardcore pvp crowd is perfectly okay with griefing? What? I don't follow that logic. Why would I openly support someone being able to ruin your day by trolling you in game."

I know some of my Jewish friends who can't have people like that in their lives and have moved from apartments because of their political differences.
0,I wish we lived in an America where the class dynamics of a meritocracy prevailed as the most plausible motive for a high school murder.,"How Jay's Intercept Interview Points to His Possible Motive First, legally speaking, motive does not matter, and in this case, we will most likely never know it even if the DNA evidence turns out to be conclusive. People's interior lives are unknowable and they do weird and irrational things all the time - that's why the law, wisely, does not include 'motive' as a legal element of a crime that must be proved. That being said, Jay's lack of motive and Adnan's supposed motive have created doubts in many people's minds. But it seems to me that it takes very little imagination to come up with a plausible motive for Jay, and that his interview sheds even more light on such a possibility. I have no idea how Jay and Hae would have connected that afternoon. But let's say they did - maybe she saw Adnan's car in the BB parking lot and stopped to say hi and then sees it's Jay - and that, as she'd intended to do at some point, she decided to confront him then, on Stephanie's birthday, about the fact that Jay was cheating on Stephanie. And in the course of that confrontation, Hae says something like ""and you aren't even good enough for Stephanie!"" Now think about Jay's interview with The Intercept and his comments about the magnet program at school. He is obviously still pissed off about that magnet program - it's grating at him - it was a 'slap in the face,' as he says. At the time of the murder, he had graduated and was little more than a loser pot dealer with no car &amp; no cell phone, and no plans at the time for college. Yet he is dating this amazing, beautiful, good-at-everything Stephanie and hanging out with these magnet kids. These kids who had it all going for them: good grades, college futures. These kids who called him when they wanted pot and upon whom he was dependent to loan him their cars and phones. These kids who were going to leave him behind and become doctors and scientists and lawyers. This must have been eating him alive. Perhaps, just perhaps, he felt threatened, intimidated, like a real loser, as if he didn't deserve someone as wonderful as Stephanie. In his heart of hearts he thought he WASN'T good enough for Stephanie or any of these kids, for that matter. And so then, when Hae says it...well that sets him off. Maybe sets off a true ""animal rage."" I would think that would be the one thing he truly couldn't hear. So it isn't so much the danger that he might lose this one girlfriend if Hae told her he was cheating, as it is that maybe Hae questioned his very right to be mingling with this sort of high-level crowd, these kids who were above him, who at school 'didn't have to interact with us anymore'....that she was in fact naming the very fear that he held deepest in his heart. And he couldn't take it. So maybe he chokes her in a rage, not meaning to kill her, but it doesn't take much given his size and hers. And that's why he mentions how he was thinking how fragile Stephanie was...he was surprised at how little it would take and that scared him. Obviously all purely speculative, but it is no more speculative than the idea that Adnan was outraged enough by the break up that he didn't actually seem upset about to squeeze in Hae's murder between track and the mosque with no plan for disposing of the body, confide in and enlist the help of someone he was not even close friends with, and just like that risk ruining a future that looked pretty darn bright."

I have been dating a great girl for the past 1.5 years. Things are pretty good. She is always down for sexy times, which is totally and completely awesome. But one problem has reared its head. When we are having sex doggystyle, I can't help but be overwhelmed by an incredibly pungent (and at times rancid) smell emanating from her rear. It smells very poopy. When the smell hits, I lose all interest and usually just stop having sex claiming to be exhausted or something. It's a huge turn off. In the immediate aftermath, I generally find myself disgusted and frustrated, as if she does not know how to bathe properly. After a little while the feelings subside and I get back to normal. I am uncertain whether or how to say something, or whether it could be some condition that I don't know about. She is a brilliant, smart girl, but she also isn't the most girly. Not that it's a telling sign, but women I have dated in the past usually have loads of different soaps and shampoos lining their showers and a multitude of lotions to fit their mood. She does not. Is there any way to lightly address this with her? Would it be better to do it in the moment or to wait until a later time when we are not having sex? I think this will really embarrass her, but I feel it has to be addressed. --- **tl;dr**: Noticed very rancid smell while having sex with GF from behind. Has happened a few times. Worried about her general hygiene. Want to say something, but don't know how or when."

0,"Dude, dump her abusive ass.","I (30/m) think I am at the end of the line with my girlfriend (32/f) First off, I very much care for and love this girl, however, I'm afraid it's become apparent that this relationship is not going to work. Long story short, she told me she thinks I'm ugly, stupid, and should go kill myself. Yesterday started off with her in a funk b/c I was leaving at noon to go play music with some friends for a while. She has expressed that she is very lonely and feels like I don't spend enough time with her and don't prioritize her. So what I have been doing lately is telling her my plans in advance so she knows what to expect and so we can make plans together. Well, on Friday I went out with her and a couple of her friends. We spent all day together Saturday, and she had accepted an invite to go hang out with some of my friends that night. At the last second, she decided to go to her friend's house to watch a movie. Sunday morning she was supposed to go to a yoga class with a friend, but wasn't feeling well and didn't. So when it comes time for me to leave, she's feeling lonely. I offered to take her out for coffee before I left but she turned it down and we departed on a sour note. I come home later and everything is fine. We go for a nice walk, eat an early dinner, and go to the grocery store. When we get home I sit down to take my shoes off and glance at my computer for a second. She gets very visibly irritated and asks if I'm going to help store the groceries. This is not the first time this has happened, so I was very irritated by her suggestion that I was not going to help unpack the groceries simply b/c I sat down after hauling them six city blocks and up two flights of stairs to our apartment. I also feel like she is constantly nitpicking everything I do. So I told her as much. Then I told her to just leave the kitchen and I'll unpack everything. We started getting in a fight, and I, lost in frustration, said that it is very apparent to me that she doesn't really like me at all and maybe it would be best if she found her own place. This is also not the first time this has come up, but it's usually her suggesting it and me talking her out of it. Basically, we've had a lot of fights like this recently, and compounded by the fact that she sets herself up to feel lonely and isolated socially to just turnaround and make it seem to be my fault, I've been thinking that her moving out is not such a bad idea. Well, she storms out of the kitchen and kicks one of the bags of groceries. I, in an embarrassing moment of rage, threw down the carton of eggs I was holding. She then proceeded to launch into a diatribe about how she's smarter than me, better looking than me, makes more money than me, and I will never find anyone better than her. Then she tells me I should just go kill myself, that I have plenty of reasons to do it (I was recently promoted at my job but screwed over on receiving a raise, so I've been down about that lately. I assume this is what she's talking about). Again, this is not the first time I've had to endure being spoken to like that from her, and I don't think I'm going to anymore. I told her that, despite however bad our arguments got, I never said anything as mean or cutting as her (I did call her the c-word in an argument a while back, of which I am ashamed). I told her that I wasn't going to put up with it anymore and she had no right to say these awful things to me. She starts talking about how I've wasted her time in this relationship, just like all of her past boyfriends. I told her that she should probably take ownership of the fact that she's chosen to stay in situations she shouldn't for long periods of time. Then she started saying that I can no longer use any of ""her stuff."" I went to hang out with a couple of my friends just to get out of the house. Later that night, I came home and she was asleep on the couch. I went and got in bed, she came in and kicked me out, saying it was ""her bed."" This morning, she wakes me up on the couch and said, ""Are you really breaking up with me for asking you to help store the groceries?"" And then proceeds to tell me that she stayed up all night thinking about killing herself, but actually I'm the one that should kill myself. I told her that I'm not putting up with any of that sort of talk anymore, that I've taken a sick day at work and she needs to get out of the house. She leaves telling me she's going to go jump off a building. This probably seems clear cut in one way or another, but I'm feeling torn. I really do care about her, but I can't keep doing this. I know I am no where near perfect, but I think I show her a lot more respect than she shows me, even when we're fighting. Anyway, there is so, so much more to this relationship, but I was just wondering if anyone had any thoughts on the current situation. I'm feeling pretty miserable right now. And feel free to criticize me over anything, or ask any questions. TL;DR - Girlfriend and I got in a fight, she said that she's smarter and better-looking than me, that I will never find someone as good as her, and that I should kill myself. Then she wakes me up this morning and says she's going to jump off a building. Thoughts?"

0,Study showing solitary confinement one day a year is damaging?,"I understand the frustration but our prison system is meant to isolate threats to communities, offer rehabilitation to those who seem capable, and hopefully rehabilitate offenders to enter back into everyday life. Justice for victims and retribution for criminals. Taxpayers are not paying for a system to be used by a judge to carry out his fetish for poetic Tit for Tat psychological game playing. Solitary confinement has shown time and time again to inflict profound psychological damage ranging from hallucinations to permanent psychosis with no documented cases of behavior improvement. Yearly confinement will most likely discourage this prisoner from making any real progress since it will fell hopeless if every year he will always endure this shaming ritual. This means he will be unfit to join any prison work programs and remain, if not increase, as a threat to the other prisoners and guards. How is that a justifiable trade off for allowing this judge to ignore ""Cruel and unusual"". The ACLU, the head fighters in freedom of speech, proved their dedication when they defended the KKK's right to a public demonstration that was being denied by a small town. I am not defending this killers actions, I am attacking this judge for his refusal to do what is best for the community and his ability to uphold the law in the name of his own twisted view on justice."

So, a couple comes in with a chihuahua that is clearly not doing well. When getting the history, they give a pretty bizarre story. It started with them noticing a possum hanging out on their property. As true country folk, they decided the best course of action would be to kill the damn thing. So, they'd ready their gun or something, right? No, the husband gets his hot poker ready and starts swinging it around, hoping to hit the possum. It's worth noting that this dude is like sixty. Instead of hitting the possum, the chihuahua jumps in front (heroic defense of it's interspecies lover?) and gets hit somewhere. They refused to specify where, but we're pretty sure it was it's head, considering the big ass lump and the general f'd upness of the dog. As a result of being attacked with a hot poker, the (FIVE POUND) chihuahua has convulsions and uncontrollable vomiting. So far, it's still alive, and it definitely has a better chance than I thought since the owners decided to go through with full treatment."

Would this story have even been a national news story or would it have been a story on page 2 of the newspaper saying three individuals were killed?

I try to get better, but I am in no desire to get on the fast track to the top 5. That still means my tech skill is miles above my friends.

And when they lose, my friend literally said to me, ""You know, sometimes playing with you is fun, but you always get to a point where you try to make it as not fun as possible."" What kind of a dick says that? I know he is mad that he loses, but how the fuck is that not intended to make me feel like a piece of shit? Who the fuck honestly thinks I am trying to make the game not fun? Like I'm an asshole for trying my hardest. If want to beat me, put in the effort to beat me. I'm not going to hold back to make you feel better about yourself. I am trying my hardest because I like to challenge myself and I want to challenge him. And sometimes I will hold back.

Doesn't post online, ""My friend plays Cage and he constantly uses run cancels to pressure me. How should I get around this?"" He doesn't read anything, or watch anything.

In my opinion micro-bursting or tap firing is a much more effective strategy for hitting people at long range because firing multiple shots increases your hit probability if you're using a weapon that doesn't have great accuracy, plus you suppress your target, and being on full auto means you're always ready for a close up engagement. I think there should be a small bonus added to semi-auto mode to make it a more viable option. Something like a slight accuracy increase or lower recoil."

A comment suggesting that unbisoft intentionally hurt their own game just to damage Nintendos third party support is the top comment at +54 That's not 1 fanboy, that's 54 fanboys and the majority of opinion in this thread and the r\games subreddit. That level of hysterical bias is toxic for discussion on a gaming forum. Lets be very clear. Nintendo are the only ones that destroyed their prospects for third party support. They produced a console that can't handle ""next gen""games. To claim that developers have some kind of vendetta against them is pure delusion. I'll remind you again that that statement is part of the top comment. Pure Nintendo fanboyism. They make great exclusive titles but deserve huge criticism for many things like their approach to online gaming, treatment of digital content and of course shit third party support because of relatively poor hardware compared to competitors."

0,Nice write up!,"Exploring the Gauntlets of Azrarel So, as we all know, the Gauntlets of Azrael (Gloves when unevolved) went public yesterday after the multiplayer seasons ended. This being the fourth Epic gear (the second of the update) and the third multiplayer exclusive gear, it's effects are highly desirable. Aside from the health boost, the fully fused Gauntlets include both a 95% chance to LIFE DRAIN on COMBO ENDERS, and a 95% chance that LIFE DRAIN will HEAL the TEAM. This adds another buff to combo enders when paired with Ra's Al Ghul's Scimitar. This is perfect for two-hit combo enders such as Arkham Origins Deathstroke's, Raven's, New 52 Nightwing's, Killer Frost's, Hawkgirl's, Cassandra Cain Batgirl, and more. If the character has a one hit combo ender, there is a 95% chance that it will life drain and heal the team. However, if it is a two hit combo ender, *both hits* have a 95% chance to life drain. The same goes for the heal team. However, do not expect to get both life drain and heal team on both hits, though it can happen. As with all life drain, the Gauntlets will heal you by whatever damage you deal. If you deal 7k damage and life drain procs, you'll heal 7k damage. With the Gauntlets come new gear setups for many characters, considering heal on special one gears (such as Knife Collection and Mutated Bone Spikes) are no longer absolutely necessary. If using the Gauntlets, the best setup for a character would be one of the following: - Gauntlets of Azrael - Ra's Al Ghul's Scimitar - Promethium Longsword/Charged Escrima Sticks This team is ideal for buffing up both basic attacks and, specifically, the combo ender. Something to note: if crit procs on the same combo ender that life drain procs on, you WILL receive the crit damage in health rather than the 'actual' damage. This setup would be better for two hit combo enders, such as Arkham Origins Deathstroke. - Gauntlets of Azrael - The Ibistick - Knife Collection/Mutated Bone Spikes The main goal of this composition is to maximize the effects on specials while maintaining a steady flow of health. The target will be life drained on combo enders, receive more damage and DOT on specials, and you receive power generation, a health increase, and heal on special one. This setup is ideal for glass cannons, such as Ares or Arkham Origins Deathstroke. Alternatively, if using a character who is heavily reliant on their special 2 (cough cough Ares cough cough) it might be better to use a heal on special two, such as Kryptonian Battle Suit (also a nice health boost). - Gauntlets of Azrael - Promethium Longsword - Blade of the War God OR Knife Collection/ Mutated Bone Spikes This team revolves around basic damage, giving huge boosts and crit chances. If using a character with lower damage but higher health (think Regime Killer Frost) the Blade of the War God would be better, due to the fact that this gives them a chance to deal more damage. If using a glass cannon (think Cassandra Cain Batgirl) the heal on special one gear would be more ideal to keep them alive at all costs. - Gauntlets of Azrael - Dual Revolvers - The Ibistick Note: this setup is specifically for Harley Quinn. This setup is the perfect way to ensure that Quinn can efficiently keep your team alive (THREE different ways to heal team: combo ender, special two, and the ""random"" boost on special two) while making sure she herself can stay alive (Gauntlets' health boost) and quickly build power to her special 2 (Ibistick's generation boost), AND cause DOT on her specials. Additionally, her signature gear and the Ibistick will provide a damage boost to her special 1, but this is not as useful as her special two. Please let me know anything else you have noticed about the Gauntlets, and any other compositions you can think of!"

0,"Fair assessment, I see the math in it now.","None of that stuff matters if they are at the same rate. If OP has X dollars per month to pay toward the loans, as long as X is at least the amount of the minimums, it doesn't matter mathematically where OP puts the excess for the purposes of total interest paid. The term is not relevant, you can assume that the minimum payment is sufficient to pay off the loan by the end of the term. If one term is longer than another it still will not affect total interest paid as long as OP continues to put X dollars per month towards any of the loans. It may make sense to pay the smaller one first for cash flow reasons, but not for total interest paid."

(expectedly, the board game adaptation of Civilization falls into the former category - don't like it, very much, but certainly not bad) There's also the division of tabletop into European Style (German) or Thematic games, the former being very mechanically oriented (their board gaming industry got really good in absence of vidya (due to certain bans/censorship)) and the latter with some European style elements but with the added mix of trying to fit the mechanics into a historical, or thematic context.

0,Now kiss,"An unexpected friendship Hey Reddit This is my first post ever, so please bare with me. So, i was just about to hit 100 lp and therefore go to promotion series to gold 1. I queued up, got in a lobby, got my main role and was ready to do my best. The game started casually with just farming and small trades, but no kills. Until our jungler fiddlesticks tried to gank the enemy Ahri in mid. Ahri managed to outplay our mid and jungler and get a kill on fiddle of it. They brushed it of and kept playing normally. Then when fiddlesticks came to gank bot, he gave up a kill to the enemy botlane. That was when he had enough, and he made the decision to just troll. Flashing, random ults, giving free kills to the enemy etc. (The rest of us were playing ok). But the enemy got too strong, and with a 1 man advantage, they finished the game after 25 minutes. I didn't get angry, i just felt really tired of league at that moment. It just felt unfair since the game was actually going pretty well for me. So i added him after the game, and surprisingly he accepted my friendrequest. So i wrote to him, and asked why he decided to troll a winnable game and if he cant see that it affects others, as myself for example. He quickly replied that he just didnt give a s*** about other people. His answer didn't really surprise me. But after a bit of talking, i got the feeling of that he actually was a nice guy. So i decided to try to talk this guy in the right direction. And after about 30 minutes of talking, he told me that he was 14 and had some serious trouble at his school, aswell as home in his family, and playing League is the only thing he loves doing. He also told me that he didn't really have alot of friends. So even though he was acting like a jerk in that game, i really felt sorry for the kid. So i invited him to play some normal games with me and my friends, wich he wanted to, and we stomped 2 games in a row. This was just about about a month ago, and nowadays i talk to him almost daily through skype. Today when i logged on after 3 days of intense studying, i got a gift from him. DJ Sona with the text ""To the nicest person ive ever met"". One of my proudest moments in my life, for sure."

0,"For the latter, do you mean hosts?","A funny thing I found out about maid cafe's while living in Japan is that they're actually pretty popular with girls! I also always looked at maid cafe's as kind of a 'geek' trap, since their drinks are pretty damn pricey and there's even an entry fee at a lot and I always assumed the appeal was just to ogle at cosplaying girls. But *some*, emphasis on *SOME*, maid cafe's are actually just pretty much normal cafe's but the uniforms and decor are themed. On the other hand, some are really just taking advantage of lonely dudes. I mean cmon, 600 yen coffee and 1200 yen omurice? I better be getting some t shirts or something. There's usually additional services at the otaku focused places like paying for talking time. Pretty sure I'm interesting enough to not have to pay people to talk to me. It's basically preying on people's insecurities and making a profit."

0,"I freaking love three hook bras, why Cleo doesn't do them I will never fully understand.","Does 3 hook closure provide more stability in the band vs 2 hook (thinking overall band width here?) Full disclosure: I'm a noob. Just wondering... Does having a 3 hook closure (and therefore a wider band) make a bra more supportive ie less dependant on straps, reduced back pain and less cutting into ""back fat""? More is more, right? I know I read a blog that casually mentioned how a certain model scaled from 2 hooks to 3 right around my size (30-34 F or FF) though I can't remember which blog or bra. On a personal note: I probably can't wear a longline because I'm shortwaisted yet my lumps and bumps spill over the back of my comfortably firm 2 hook bras. A 3 hook closure seems like a happy medium. **Anybody have any experience with 3 hooks being better than 2?**"

0,Hou yi's ult is for early damage and objective zoning.,"I'll just go by the ones this year: Hou Yi - Anti-Stealth and basically built to counter his own class. His ricochet and golden crow mark are very unique with how they work, and his ultimate is... interesting despite being super easy to walk out of. Bellona - I like that she switches between weapons and has a very brutal warrior-ish vibe to her that the other Warriors lack. Her weapons feel like they have weight to them, if that makes any sense, and her kit feels great for getting into fights and basically creating havoc. Medusa - She's an interesting ability-based hunter, basically Neith only being the other one like her. Her kit theme is pretty neat, and her ultimate is one of those types that's a massive game-changer when used properly. Also the whole turning gods into stone upon execution is great. In general she feels like a strong duelist type who also has an insanely strong ultimate for teamfights. Ah Puch - God is he annoying. But he's great at what he does - zoning. I also like that we actually have a death-themed god that embraces more of the underworld-type stuff and feels darker than the other death gods. He also doesn't have a bloated kit like others do (i.e. Hou Yi/Bellona/Medusa all have pretty heavy kits with all that they do), but he's great at countering certain healing gods and being a massive nuisance. Fortunately he has very big weaknesses to counter his power. Ratatoskr - I like the idea of actually having an evolving personal god item. Like it would be really cool if more gods or maybe a few existing gods could get stuff like that. I also like the idea of him being an assassin who darts in and out while being fairly squishy. He's a major annoyance in a good way I guess. Though he is still pretty overly powerful with how his dash resets so often. Nox 2.0 - I overall love her kit. It has a learning curve but it's very rewarding to master. Shadow Dash has so many possibilities with what it can combo with. She's got huge zoning potential and is able to pretty much shut down ability-heavy gods. And her long cooldowns force you to learn how to make the most with her abilities when you have them available (plus it keeps her from being OP like she is in the MotDs with 80% CDR and Infinite Mana). Ravana - I like his kit idea and the fact that he fights like a brutal monk with his bare fists instead of needing weapons. But it still feels like the kit doesn't fit the god."

But why is it that some people have such an issue with games that don't have 50 guns and camos and perks to unlock and equip? Why is it that myself and many others can play and enjoy a game like Counter Strike for years when it never changes yet some people can't play Titanfall for a week without getting bored? It makes me wonder what kind of games these people play for more than a month, if any. This sentiment that Titanfall gets boring quickly is giving the game a bad reputation and pushing new players away. I see so many people say that ""x"" game is bad because it doesn't have this game mode or this customization option or whatever. It seems like modern games have made people unappreciative of good, fun gameplay which is the whole point of playing games in the first place.

Seriously. I might as well just play BO1 on my xbone when/if it becomes backwards compatible. Early DLC deals are so stupid. The only way this deal can't ruin CoD is if PS only gets it a week or two early. Zombies is completely ruined by early DLC. Also, I've only gotten 3 DLC packs that would be affected by the early DLC packs so I haven't had a chance to appreciate the early DLC on xbox. Honestly, being on the short end of the DLC deal made me realize how shitty this is. Activision would make more money and more people would buy the game if SEASON PASS HOLDERS GOT DLC EARLY. Why hasn't anyone at Activision realized this?"

0,I prefer - Unconditional Basic Standard Income.,"Basic Income should be Occupy's new rallying cry I've been thinking long and hard about how to get BI off the ground, and it seems to me that the one thing we lack is widespread support from the general public... in short we don't have enough voices. OWS fell into obscurity after its initial boom not because it was prevented from growing, but because it didn't have a *cohesive* message... it lacked a strong ideal in favour of the ""everyone's opinion matters and should be given equal airtime"" approach.... if it had a core message, it was most certainly ""income disparity exists, and is bad, mkay?""... but not everyone agreed on that (some people felt that was ""too socialist"" a message), and there was never any plausible solution to rally behind... I'd say that any movement that serves to identify a problem without proposing any decent solutions is doomed to fail... particularly once it's been infiltrated with people that don't really care about the problem at the core of the movement, and have ""solutions"" that would only serve to make the problem worse. Now, it seems to me that Basic Income was the solution OWS didn't have a grasp on at the time. The BI education movement started after the OWS movement had lost steam.... and now we're two separate (but often overlapping) groups with the same goal. The difference between us is that the BI movement has a *really good plan* while OWS still to this day has a *lot* of supporters that we haven't managed to tap into yet. So, I propose a question: What will in take to re-invigorate Occupy with Basic Income as its core mantra?"

From that small list of doctors, I looked into their credentials (e.g., did they go to university of No Name school or Univeristy of Michigan) first. I then looked at any affiliations (medical society, FACOG, etc). From that even smaller list, we made appointments with the doctors office and asked various questions. For example, will they answer email questions we may have or do we always have to drive in? How do they feel about dispensing medication (e.g., is everything resolved with a pill or do you practice ""wait and see"" medicine). Basically, ask whatever is important to you and your SO.

It was only a loud ALRIGHT and a loud NO, but it deeply hurt my wife. At home we have methods to prevent fighting or snapping, but there I have no outlet. I cant even go to bed early to escape the stress of it all. Im grateful they habe given up on seperating us. We dont believe in sex segregation, so if it comes down to it we will sit in a hallway between the men section and women section. One thing I refuse to cave on, ever. This was really a tipping point, the entitlement and idea I need to control my wife better."
0,"Don't want to scare the ""emergency managers"" now!","I moved to Michigan ~1 year ago and just found out that I have to register my handguns in this state. Am I facing major legal penalties? Should I just go bury my guns and start fresh? I realize that I made a mistake by not getting up to date on the gun laws of the land I was moving to, and even more of a mistake by not checking on them once I was here. I'm not an avid shooter obviously, But I do have a couple pistols that I guess have to be registered in this state. Having moved here from a western state with hardly any gun laws this seems a bit scary, the fact that I inadvertently broke the law. From what I can find, Michigan requires you to register handguns within 30 days on moving here, well I'm way past that point. I found one page indicating that I could be facing 90 days in jail and a fine. I clearly don't want any of that, so it seems like my only recourse would be to go dig a few deeps holes in the yard and scatter the pieces of my guns. I guess now I'm classified as a criminal according to this state and that freaks me out a bit. I'm as square as they come - I've never even been pulled over in ~20 years of driving - so you can see why I'm scared given the situation I've found myself in. Any advice?"

Lately it's been in my mind a lot. I recently bought home a gorgeous spaniel puppy, who I love to bits. When researching diets and care for springer spaniels on the Internet, I stumbled across their general lifespan: 12-14 years. For some reason, this really freaked me out. I've already become so attached to the little guy I couldn't bear losing him. The idea that he'll die in such a short amount of time terrifies me. In turn, it got me thinking about the deaths of my family and friends, mainly my mum and siblings, and now I'm scared because, as the youngest by a number of years, I'll probably outlive nearly all of them. I don't really care about my own death, never have, but I hate hate hate thinking about the people I love dying. I'm not religious and I don't believe in an afterlife, which makes it worse as the loss is permanent - I'll never see them again. Does anyone else share these fears?"
0,I think the assumption is that he's being hired to develop a new Spider-Man theme that is reminiscent of his original.,"Everybody's misunderstanding the Danny Elfman thing. Danny Elfman is VERY likely composing new music for Age of Ultron. If a track was being used from a previous film, say a Spider-Man or Hulk film, he would not get a poster credit for it. The song would appear in the licensed music credits at the end. Its why you don't see ""Additional Music by Ennio Morricone"" on every Quentin Tarantino Poster ever. The Captain America March by Alan Silvestri was used in Winter Soldier. But only Henry Jackman is poster credited. HOWEVER It may be that Danny Elfman has composed a theme for a character we haven't seen yet. A character who will appear in a future film (Say Black Panther or Captain Marvel). It would be more likely that he would get a credit for that, because it wouldn't be licensing a pre-existing theme. Note that Doctor Strange and Ant-Man have composers that aren't Danny Elfman, so it most likely isn't them. TL,DR: If Danny Elfman's Spider-Man theme was being used, he wouldn't get a ""additonal music"" poster credit for Age of Ultron."

Sure it may be a digital steam title but this way, they could offer at a lower price and get a huge profit in return because steam is gaining and gaining more subscribers. At some point, all games will be on the computer because consoles are dying. It's only a matter of time until computers become even more powerful and much much smaller. Imagine having the most powerful desktop computer loaded with 4 titan x video cards with 12gb vram but compressed into the size that fits into your hand.

0,The only reason the Allison/Yarborough fight is looked back in a positive way is because it was something that finally brought NASCAR to the public's attention and because NASCAR hadn't yet shed it's redneck image.,"Some food for thought after this week. As I've been thinking about the incident yesterday and how many people view this brawl on pit road bad media for the sport, I've come up with an idea that I would like to hear other's opinions on. It's 1979, last lap of the Daytona 500, Cale Yarborough and Donnie Allison are fighting for the win, when all of a sudden, they hit each other and wreck, handing Richard Petty the win. As their cars are lying in the infield, they get out say a few words and begin to fight. 34 years later, we remember this incident as one of the greatest moments in NASCAR history. Now my argument is, what is the difference between these two incidents. Both incidents were not caused by any one driver, both going for an important win, and tempers boiled over at the end resulting in a fight, yet one is considered one of the greatest moments in NASCAR history and one is considered a shit stain on the image of NASCAR. Downvote me, disagree with me, I don't care, I'm just putting my opinion out there and want to see what you all think about my thoughts."

So yesterday, she finally says: ""I think I have my girl name now"" She says it, it sounds pleasant enough, and it has meaning for her. This is a big thing, because she's very ""eh. whatever"" about a lot of names, where I'm more into them. So cool, she has her name. Then she hands me her phone... ""And this is how I'm thinking of spelling it."" I look at the screen and OMG it's the most obnoxious spelling of that name I can imagine. And while I'm (figuratively) choking, and going ""Really? Really? That spelling?"", she's laughing. Later, over dinner she goes: ""You know, I had to do that. How often do I get the opportunity to make you go WTF?"" Then she tells me the name she's actually thinking about, and the spelling, which is much, much better. TL;DR Wife takes advantage of choosing her name to play a joke on me. P.S. Now, that she finally settled on a name, she finally changed it on Facebook, so yay for this secret-keeping thing to be over."

This saturday, I'm going to a house party with my girlfriend, we're both 21, but all her friends are 20, some 21. I'm not sure the size of the party, but sizable, and supposedly everyone is sleeping there including my girlfriend and I. My worries are guys hitting on her and how to deal with it. Never been in that situation really, I would like to think I'd handle it maturely and she'd probably just tell them she's with me as I'd probably be standing right there with her. We talked about my insecurity about that (I know, not sexy) but I just said like ""I know you love me but I just have anxiety about these things"" she just said ""Just keep being awesome and you won't have to worry"" jokingly. She just says stuff like it won't happen and it never does. Her and I typically blend in and are fairly shy but still a worry of mine. My other concern is the sleeping arrangement, I have this fear we will all be sleeping on top of each other and it'll be super uncomfortable. I asked what we were doing she said if I don't drink we could just go back to her house and sleep there but she doesn't want to do that and that being the answers to all my fears, I'm still not going to be selfish and ruin a party she wants to be apart of. Come sunday, we will be cuddling and relaxing so I guess I have that to look forward to. All in all, I am 90% sure I will have a good time. Its just these stupid fears that aren't guaranteed to happen that surface in the coming days leading up to these things and then I'm miserable leading up to it. I want to know how I can talk myself calm without driving my girlfriend crazy."

I built first outside Ranchito and a few days later he showed up. I waved at him to be nice and he swung his ax at me. So I ignored him. In 3 days he constructed a complex 5 deck base each with 2 levels and torches. Now he waves at me. OK cool. I found a car and put up a tampered garage. I went to him and said I could share the code on that door with him. I offered to share the car. He stood there waving. Should have been my first warning. So this week now he has about 7 bases all connected around a car park campground. He is back and forth with metal, placing furnaces and grills in the camp even though you can see each of his decks have them. Yesterday I logged in and saw 2 shacks outside my tamper. Inside was a staircase, a workbench and a locked shack. Inside the car were materials for more structures like logs metal and doors and walls. I quickly abandoned the area and found somewhere else. You are rIght. This is PVE and no matter what any of us thinks we go to it to avoid the crap that can happen with bases in PVP. This kind of griefing is pointless. He couldn't actually steal the car so I guess he was going to block it with sheds. I am on a pretty low pop server and have yet to see anyone in this area since I built so it has to be him. I didn't want to horde the car, I offered full access to the base. Yet he still tried to grief me. Let me also say his connecting bases were growing towards mine not away so it was only a matter of time before he invaded me anyway. Just ridiculous."

If a whale washes up on the beach and it can't be gotten rid of immediately, it's best to lance the carcass so that gasses can easily escape before they explode rotten whale everywhere."

And when you do get the satchel, all you typically get is a pointless +50 stat bonus for an hour. These are not BoP and can be purchased on the AH for about 80g (if you really care about that tiny of a stat boost). If you're not a min-maxer these are almost pointless.

0,"If you're freaking out about whether or not you might need to chop of your tits, you're *probably* not feeling all that in the mood to get sexy with a friend.","My GF of 6 months had her friend do a breast exam GF = Amanda Her friend = Jack Amanda and I met on OKC back in July. We hit it off really well, but took it slowly as I'd come out of a long term relationship 4 months beforehand. After two months of dating we agreed to become exclusive and it's been great so far. We get on with each others friends and we haven't had any big fights. Last week Amanda thought she found a lump in her left breast. It happened while we were showering together at my place, and she started to freak out a little. She wouldn't stop talking about how she didn't want to have cancer so I put on a movie and we cuddled on the couch to take her mind off it until she could see a professional about it. I've made the mistake of googling smyptoms in the past before so I know how hard it can be to get it off your mind when you're convinced you have a major disease. She has a friend from her student days, Jack, who works as a doctor now, and it turns out she asked him to do a breast exam on her in her home. Turns out it was from an infection and he prescribed pills to help with it. I'm glad she's okay, but I think it was really inappropriate for her to have Jack conduct the exam instead of her usual doctor, given she's mentioned in passing before that they used to hook up. Am I overreacting? tldr: GF's doctor friend/ex-fwb did a home breast exam for her, I think it's inappopriate. Am I wrong?"

Finally I went home and put a dumbbell I had on the scale and finally I realized that my scale at home was not only broken and gradually saying I weighed less and less but I had gained like an extra 5-10 pounds because I was trying to eat more to stop the weight loss.

0,got damn if that isn't one of the funniest stories I've ever read.,"That there was a secret, hidden room in the Delta Psi house. Ok STORY TIME! Delta Psi is a very small fraternity and on Ole Miss's campus, their membership got so low at one point they actually had to abandon their house for a while. Our house being right next door, we always had a sort of rivalry with them which mostly consisted of us doing stupid shit like throwing empty beer cans on their back patio. During this time when they weren't occupying their house, we got the bright/drunk idea to go next door and try to find their secret room. So we go over there and get in through the front door and went around the house looking for the room. We had been there for about 30 minutes and we were looking around upstairs in the bedrooms and stuff. As you can imagine, it being an abandoned house formerly occupied by college students, there was junk all over the place. Upturned mattresses, old pizza boxes, books, papers, etc. all littering the place. We had been searching upstairs for a few minutes when we hear from downstairs, ""Hey! Who's up there?!"" Our first thought was, ""oh shit, cops!"" As it wasn't our house, and we'd never been in there before, we didn't know any other way to get out besides going back down the way we came, which would lead us right past the voice. So we thought, ""shit, better hide."" So began a frantic search for hiding places. That secret room would have come in handy, if we had ever found it. We all go 10 different directions looking for shit to hide behind, rooms to go in, etc. So we're all scrambling to hide from what we think is a cop when I see my friend Barksdale. He found his hiding spot. He is standing straight up in the corner of the room, hands at his sides, with a discarded lampshade on his head. It was literally the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life. It was the kind of thing that a cartoon character would do if he were trying to hide. I never found out if he was serious or just recognized the hilarity of it. You never could tell with Barksdale. He was also the guy who pulled up beside a couple of girls who were obviously jogging and tried to hit on then by asking if they needed a ride somewhere. You never could tell if he was being serious and clueless or ironically hilarious. The disembodied voice downstairs turned out to be just a member of the fraternity that had come by checking on the house. We sheepishly just went downstairs and walked out the front door after our laughter at Barksdale made the idea of hiding our presence impossible. We never found the secret room, I doubt it ever existed and the Delta Psi's have a new house now, so unless they built a new secret room, it's gone now if it ever existed. It's been about 15 years, but that story still makes me laugh."

0,"Would this work for horizontal cardio, too?","A mind trick I've started using to get more out of my cardio sessions So I recently started working out again. Back in college I lifted daily, and got in really good shape without ever doing cardio. After entering the workforce, however, i lifted less and less, and on top of that, i was traveling for about 5 months for work, and therefore never worked out, and also ate really poorly. Anyways, now I am trying to get back in shape for aesthetic purposes. I came to the harsh realization that if i want to look how i used to, i had better ramp up the cardio. I hated the treadmill at first, and would always stare at the mile counter and struggle to meet my goals. Recently, I started using what i am calling the 3 point treadmill motivator. When running, I use the Calorie counter, the timer, and the mile counter to push myself. For example, I'll set my calorie goal to 350. i'll start running, and when i near the 350 calorie mark, i'll look at the time. 18 minutes and 30 seconds? alright go to 20 minutes pussy! nearing 20 minutes? check the mile counter. 2.12 miles? Make it to 2.5 fatass!!! Get to 2.5 miles? Check the calorie counter again! This has forced me to run longer each time, and kind of gamifies the whole workout. I find that reaching small milestones in the workout is so much easier than focusing on one aspect of the workout (miles), and feeling tired and wornout seeing it slowly tick towards that goal. Anyways, sorry if I rambled on here, but maybe this can help out someone else who is struggling to get effective cardio workouts in."

Maybe that word isn't so scary after all. When FDR rolled out the New Deal and Social Security, he was called a socialist. When LBJ rolled out medicare, he was called a socialist. Reagan used to famously long for the times before medicare as ""when men were free"". MLK was called socialist, communist, Marxist, and every other name in the book by the right when he fought for equality. Republicans/libertarians call anything and everything that improves the lives of average American as communist or socialist, forced redistribution, etc etc. It's became a buzzword designed to generate a Pavlonian response in the right wing voter base. 1% of the voting public, maybe even less, can accurately define what socialism and communism are, and the power of these buzzwords lie in the remnants of cold war propaganda. As that generation dies off, they become less effective as scary words. Maybe it's time for an American president to say in public ""Inequality threatens the fabric of American society. I want to redistribute some wealth back to the 99%."" I think American voters will be receptive."

0,Let's be real: Nobody in Kansas or Missouri knows *nearly* enough about history to have those grievances ;),"The actual start would probably be the result of some nutjob wanting to avenge something from the US civil war. Someone from Kansas will decide it's time to get revenge for Quantrill's raid or someone from western Missouri will decide it's time to burn some houses in response to Ewing's General Order 11. What would be interesting would be the immediate aftermath of the attack. Both sides would begin searching for allies in their war. Kansas prides itself on it's abolitionist origins, but it's distanced itself from the northeastern origins. Natural allies seem to be Illinois (given their similarly antagonistic history with Missouri) and Massachusetts since a healthy chunk of Kansas free soilers came from there, particularly in the city of Lawrence. Missouri would likely seek allies in the old confederate states, both due to tradition and the practicality of having access to ocean ports. Kansas would likely have a harder time gaining access to the oceans. Assuming an alliance with Illinois, Kansas would probably try to gain allies in Nebraska and Iowa to gain freer movement towards Illinois and the great lakes. I imagine Texas would attempt to remain neutral in the war, though individual areas of Texas may attempt to profit from the war either as a supplier or by allowing Kansas access to the Gulf Coast. The big thing, though, is whether current Kansas politics would poison their attempts to gain other allies. If Missouri's eastern flank is secured by old confederate allies, Kansas would have issues with supplies and likely numbers. Now, if Kansas chucked that ass Brownback on his ass and sought old Union allies, particularly in the midwest, we'd end up with Civil War 2: Electric Boogaloo. The real curiosity then would be what the western states would do."

0,Steve Hofstetter is amazing at dismantling a heckler.,"The worst heckler (and possibly the most fun at the same time) was at a show in Canton, GA. I won't name the place, but it was at a bar/nightclub. This heckler was just talking and ""adding"" to the show the whole time, and it was at a venue where they didn't have security to kick him out. A few comedians went up, and then it was my turn. My set was going decent, but about 6 minutes into my set, he yells out ""He'll pee in your butt!"" I have no idea why that came out of his mouth, but I replied with, ""Very subtle gays you have in Canton."" The crowd erupted, and laughed at that guy, and he kept quiet the rest of the time. I have a very non-confrontational personality onstage, so I've never had any extreme cases of a heckler really out of control. Also, I became really good at taking down hecklers quickly and effectively without actually attacking them. My chops were built from the many music open mics I started on in my hometown of Newnan, GA. Some of the best at destroying them I'd say are: Joe Matarese and Steve Hofstetter. All comedians need that tool in their repertoire because it is bond to happen. Any given night a comedian can destroy a heckler. There isn't really a comedian (that I know of) who only destroys hecklers."

0,Why issues like this have to be brought to Reddit instead of being actually resolved inside the system?,"From what I can gather through your screenshots, it looks like some payments for RP on your account were reversed by the payment provider. This can happen when the financial account holder disputes the transaction as fraudulent, or in some rare cases is triggered by the provider due to their own fraud protection. Simply put, the funds used to grant RP on your account appear to have been taken back, so your account was suspended pending repayment of that balance. After the negative balance is repaid, we restore access to the LoL account, and any excess value paid over the negative balance is met with an equal amount of additional RP. It wouldn't be right to credit a whole new bundle of RP for the full value, since this second payment is essentially replacing the first that was taken back. Desert Paladin is a good friend of mine, and I'm sure she wouldn't intend to confuse you. I think the screenshot you posted may be of her answering a question along the line of excess RP for excess payment, though it could have been worded more clearly. I'm going to hop over to an office connection to look into this further, just to make sure my suspicions are correct and I'm not missing anything. I'll respond to you through your support request (my name there is 2o2) and work with Desert Paladin to make sure we clear up any lingering issues. I'm really sorry that you had such a bumpy ride. This example will surely be combed over to help us level up!"

Greetings all... while I'm not an official tech support person, I do a lot of tech support for things that qualify as security tools (MDM, proxy, firewall, etc) because those that can, do, and those that can't, mess things up for the rest of us. If you recall my last story, a few years back I did a stint as a sysadmin, building and supporting and securing desktops and servers for a branch office of a large organization. I was a filthy contractor, as were my users at this particular satellite office (though they were on a different contract), and as often happens when you contract services to the lowest bidder and then drive them down on price even further, you end up with the cream of the crap. Last time you heard about Waffles. This time, you'll hear about another sad sack. We didn't have a nickname for him, so I'll dub him Loaf. I did most of my work from inside a conference room, and from time to time during the day, the other contractors would come in to use the systems that i helped maintain. The systems were on a segregated network so they had no choice but to go in there to use them, and i had no choice but spend my days in a windowless, airless room, supporting them. Microsoft has released patches on Black Tuesday for years now (and Adobe jumped on that bandwagon a couple of years ago, giving us all a double whammy of patches), and this particular second tuesday was no different. Sneakernet patches over, apply. Manually. We didn't have a tool to support automated third party patching and it was unlikely we'd get one, but fortunately we didn't have many systems to patch. My usual procedure was to remote into a few systems at once, start running patches on them, keep an eye on them until it was done (usually not long), check them off my list, and move on to the next few. So at the time of this story, i was on my 'main' system, logged into the other systems into the room, patching them. Yeah i could have sat in front of them and done them one at a time but come on... it was bad enough i had to patch everything manually, the last thing i wanted to do was sit at the workstation where Waffles was known to trim his toenails and leave the clippings laying around (f*cking waffles). So everyday i'm patchin', and Loaf walks in and walks up to one of the computers. Let's set the scene. You walk up to a computer. It's not locked (oddity #1). There are a couple of installers running on the screen (oddity #2). And I'm staring daggers at you from across the room (okay, not odd at all). What would a normal person do? A normal person would be like, ""Hey Starla, are you patching these? I need to do my report, when will they be ready?"" Not Loaf. Unable to comprehend what he was faced with, he sat down and started closing the installer windows and opened up outlook. *My* outlook. ""Loaf, what ~~the hell~~ are you doing?"" ""Checking my email so i can do reports."" I'm not known for being rendered speechless, but my jaw hit the floor so hard the motion sensors in the ceiling tiles registered an intrusion. He continued. ""What's wrong with this computer? This doesn't look like my email."" Ah, there it was -- my old friend, anger. My jaw snapped back shut. ""Loaf, i was logged into that system patching it."" ""How was i supposed to know that?"" Oh, it's on. ""Because the lock screen wasn't displayed when you walked in? Because there were installers open on it?"" He stared at me incomprehendingly. ""Because when you use a computer on this network the FIRST THING YOU DO EVERY TIME IS MASH CONTROL ALT DELETE, ~~fatfinger your password four times, make me reset it,~~ and then ~~finally~~ successfully log in? And THEN, and ONLY THEN, do you open up Outlook and check your mail?"" Kim Kardashian couldn't have given me a blanker stare. ""Let's start over. Did you just come on shift?"" ""Yes."" ""So, it's safe to say that you didn't log in earlier and leave the computer unlocked, right?"" ""What?"" Too many steps, must dumb it down further. ""Since you just got here, you probably weren't just using the computer, right?"" ""Right."" ""And you have to lock the computer before you leave it, right?"" ""Right."" ""So no matter what, you would have to unlock the computer and log in before you could check your mail, right?"" ""Yes."" ""Then what were you thinking when you walked in, saw the computer already logged into, closed the installer windows that were open, and then opened outlook?"" ""I was going to check my email so I could do the afternoon report."" ""But you never logged into the computer."" ""I'm not sure what you mean."" I gave up. ""Loaf, I'm patching systems. You can't use them right now but they'll be ready in a few minutes. I'll come out and let you know when."" He loafed back out of the room and i restarted the process. A few minutes later, it occurred to me that he was probably the one behind the random account lockouts we were plagued with in our office... he was probably coming in, trying to log into someone else's account that already had the system locked (extremely common, people usually left themselves logged in and used switch user, and most people knew to make sure they were trying to log into their own account), locking them out, and calling me to reset his password because it wasn't working. We knew Waffles had done that more than once, apparently more than one user was in need of some retraining via clue-by-four. Office Manager naturally heard about this through the grapevine and rather than dealing with his idiot contractors properly, accused me of being too mean to them. Given that he was prone to screaming fits and directly responsible for the extremely high turnover rate in the office, it seemed a bit disingenuous for him to accuse me of such, but by then I was used to being the scapegoat for every failing of his team. Such is life."

My mind gets motivated to seek out a ton of great books, maybe I'll go as far as buying a few new ones, but when I ultimately look at my library... I stare and don't really know where to start to the point that my momentum slows and the ambition to conquer what seemed like a great idea fades. So here I am, with a certain set of skills I've spent a good portion of my life working on, but with something missing. Spirituality? Maybe, I know hardly anything about it, never been taught any form of religion. Knowledge? Meh, not sure. I love the idea of delving in deep somewhere but how do you pick a subject? Better yet how do you filter and have perspective on what's important? More Entertainment? Nah I already spend enough time looking at screens walking away with very little gained. What I'm missing is a second passion and I have no idea how to find what it is. Clearly I'm here which means I've gone as far as googling ""great subreddit's to learn""... but that's as far as the hunt has gone. Since I'm looking for guidance and help I'll drop a quote I engraved onto the back of my ipad (yup, that guy). ""Get Better At Everything"". But come on now, that's very easy to talk about without actually pulling the trigger and committing. I guess my question is how the hell do you deal with the monumental weight that is 'square one'?

0,"Honestly, it sounds like your poltergeist needs to fuck off.","Reality collapses. Ever since I can remember, some strange things have been happening to and around me. I could describe these phenomenom as momentary collapses from reality. The most re-occurring oddity happens when I go to sleep. Almost every night before falling asleep, I hear loud popping and cracking noises, I have them in the minutes after I've woken up and during sleep paralysis, but never at other times. I've managed to brush those off as auditory hallucinations, even though I have never been diagnozed with anything that could cause those. Then I have situations where inanimate objects around me ""become alive."" To give an example, I was once upon sitting with someone at a table, and was about to say something when the flower vase in front of me literally exploded. It was not the first time something like this happened, and the fact that another person witnessed made no difference, all I could do was say ""Well, that happened, so there must be a logical explanation for it, even though neither of could come up with one."" But it keeps happening and I don't have explanation for books falling off shelves or fruit rolling around on the floor by itself. Lately I have also began to see bright/dark distortions in my visual spectrum that show up at interesting times, then disappear whenever I focus my eyes on them. These are just few in a gallery of experiences that I can not explain. I am curious whether anyone here had similiar experiences that make you guestion your sanity. Experiences that make you contemplate whether this phenomenom occurs only in your reality tunnel or if it also happen to some or many, but are never brought up because they lack explanation and therefore are rationalized and brushed off."

If all they do is dump their hand in 3 turns and hit face, it doesn't feel very interactive or fun for the person getting hit. The opponent didn't do anything clever or outplay you, and you didn't get the chance to outplay them. Agro decks are important to stop control decks from getting too greedy and not run any early game, and yes, Agro decks are nice for new players because they tend to be cheaper, but they shouldn't be so mindless as to just dump everything and win. They should have to play around *Something*... I guess what I'm trying to say is we need more cards that can better fight Agro, and we need better basic or cheap high cost cards to promote newer players playing control - style decks. TL;DR: Agri is complained about because people fighting it don't feel like the Agro player, or themselves, did anything special/interesting to win"

0,Even though I agree with most of it I don't think that the Brock vs Bryan would've been a good story line (though better than reigns ),"The ACTUAL sequence of events that led to Roman Reigns getting booed. (AKA Chris Jericho and Santino are wrong, and here's why.) The Royal Rumble may have been the first time he was actively booed to such a degree, but it is not the sole reason behind the hate. Like Stroud said, it started long before that. I thought I would type this out to remind everyone just how long this has been brewing (forgive me if I get some things out of order). The Shield breaks up. Dean goes into a hot feud with Rollins while Roman goes into a cold feud with Randy Orton. Roman wins, nobody cares because it's sandwiched between Nikki Bella's heel turn (yes, people cared more about this) and Brock squashing Cena. Roman gets hurt. Dean gets extremely fucking over during that same Rollins feud. Roman, meanwhile, is made to cut shitty satellite promos in what is the real first step of his downfall. WWE feels as though they have to remind us on a weekly basis that Roman Reigns still exist, even though absolutely no one forgot. It is also heavily rumored that Roman Reigns is planned to go over Brock Lesnar at WrestleMania 31. Next, Dolph Ziggler gets the spot Roman probably was supposed to get at Survivor Series, and also gets mega fucking over for it. This is while Reigns is still cutting the terrible satellite promos. The Punk podcast happens. This is not the sole cause, as some people have claimed, but it does draw more attention to WWE's Reigns agenda. Roman Reigns wins Superstar of the Year. Some people think it's legit, some don't. What I think most people agree on is that it was completely undeserved given the other people on the list, and even if it WAS legit, it still came off as WWE forcing it within the context of the other stuff. Perception is reality. Reigns is then inserted into NXT Takeover: R Evolution, and he says that he's going to be the first NXT Alumnus to win the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. Everyone's like, ""WTF, he wasn't even there that long."" He comes back at TLC. The return itself is pretty hot, and then he completely fucks up the promo afterwards, mispronouncing a simple word like declare and then standing there like a goofus. Daniel Bryan comes back and inserts himself into the Royal Rumble. Everyone goes nuts, thinking there's hope after HAVING PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT that Reigns was a lock to win. Reigns cuts the sufferin' succotash promo, and then the Jack and the Beanstalk promo. Everyone assumes that there's no way he could be getting the big push if he's cutting promos this bad. Cue that familiar Edge video. WWE books the absolute worst Royal Rumble match in history, making the previous year's look like a delicious piece of cake in comparison. They take that hot Ambrose push and say fuck you. They take the rise of Dolph Ziggler and say fuck you. And yes, most importantly, they take the return of Daniel Bryan, and possibly one of the best stories we could have ever had, and say fuck you. Then they bring in the fucking Rock to try and force us to cheer the guy. And because the rest of this shit has been so ridiculous, THE ROCK GETS BOOED. In the weeks that follow, they attempt to make Bryan look like the bad guy who is attempting to steal Reigns' spot, and then have Reigns beat him. Bryan endorses him and the people who have paid enough attention to this entire thing are not buying it. WrestleMania now features the three stars of the fall in a nice, big ladder match while the Chosen One gets to headline WrestleMania, after WWE has done an absolutely, astonishingly, outrageously bad job of building him up. And they are so cowardly and insecure at the idea of Reigns not being over that they are not going to have him face off with Lesnar until the very last week. Also, the story has become more about Lesnar with him basically serving as Punk 2011, circa 2015, which I'm sure is not going to help the WrestleMania reaction for Reigns. There's the full, complete, and correct narrative on how this came to be. Believe that."

The conditions are terrible, there is little room for advancement, there is a high chance you will be injured, and depending on the job, the pay is sometimes terrible. Most people who work manual jobs will only do it for a short period of time (like waitressing), and those who work difficult manual labour for long periods of time often have more serious problems, like illiteracy, a criminal record, addiction problems, lack of basic education, and even being an undocumented worker. Let me put it this way, if we don't encourage men to go into manual labour, then why would we encourage women to go into manual labour?"

It really depends on if you think the writing is good enough to make Ash's character fit with his achievements, or make his skill level consistent, and what do you think are the requirements to be a good or bad trainer, and if those requirements apply to the anime the same way they do the games."

0,I didn't fully read this but isn't this just pro points?,"Points system for Competitive? This is just a random thought I came up with but what if your placing at lan gave your team/orgs points. So the idea is basically if you place in the top 8 at an event, you get given points based off where you finished. For example - 1st - 16 points 2nd - 14 points 3rd - 12 points 4th - 10 points 5th - 8 points 6th - 6 points 7th - 4 points 8th - 2 points Or any other set of points 1-8 or 10-80. Doesnt really matter So then every event you place top 8 you get points, and this goes on for the whole game and can determine who is the best team/org - I only say orgs cause it could be the orgs who get the points, so you cant just keep changing your roster for points. Haven't really thought about this part much. Then when it comes to the last event it could be double or triple points for placing top 8. which could move teams up a lot or down. Then whoever has most points could win a money prize or just get trophies for most points. The points system could also work at champs for double or triple points as this is midway through the game. I think it could work in competitive, as with pro points you can acquire points from online tournaments, which doesn't really show off how many points you scored during lan. You could even have it as the players get the points as well as the team. So you can see who has been the best in the game due to the amount of points they have gotten. So like I said this was just a random idea of mine, if it has been submitted before I haven't seen it, but tell me what you think!"

I've said this before and I'll say it again: Winston is the exact opposite of what produced Aaron Rodgers. Rodgers was basically told his whole career in football that he wasn't good enough, no offers out of high school, only one in JUCO, then he was passed up by almost every team in the draft, only then to be sat behind a legend and told he could never live up to him. Winston, however, has been told his entire life that he is the best thing since sliced bread and he believes that he can get away with more shit than he actually can because of it. Basically: he's just plain full of himself. The best guys are always humble and focused, Winston is none of those. The only rounds I would be OK with us taking a chance on Winston in would be the 6th or 7th round, and that's my grade for him unless he by some miracle of Christ Himself changes his entire worldview. Winston is a 6th round prospect simply on personality alone."

For instance, once we had a visitor get up at the end right before announcements to announce to us all that anyone who was a member of our church was in danger of the fires of Hell, because we had a woman read a scripture that morning in church. Then he hopped off the stage and left. As far as I'm aware, nobody in our church knew who he was or where he went or anything. So what about you? Strange preacher illustrations? Visitors acting up?

0,You likely have patella femoral syndrome which is when the patella tracks improperly from a muscle imbalance.,"Chronic knee issues, anyway to fix them? I've been trying to do longer rides recently, but I seem to have some kind of chronic knee issue and I have no idea how to get rid of it. It started about 3 years ago on a hiking trip up the mountains in Colorado. 3 days in the side of my right knee started killing me until I could barely walk and had to stop. It lingered over several days with sharp pains stabbing at me with every step, but eventually after a few weeks of rest it went away. Since then it's come back at several points. Anytime I try running on a treadmill at a gym it only takes about 15 minutes for it to surface and if I try to power through it my knee gets wrecked for a week again. Biking is usually fine, but I've tried two long rides (50 miles) with some hills and the knee pain came back at about 30 miles. I powered through the pain both times causing me to not be able to walk for a few days after. The pain comes from a very precise point on the outer side of my knees (they both get it now) in that divet area right below the knee bone. The pain surges with steps and pressure and is killer going up stairs or hills. I've gone to a PT once and they couldn't give me a clear diagnosis. They said they thought it was ""jumper's knee"" or ""patellar tendonitis."" They gave me some PT exercises and told me to check back in. None of the exercises worked and the PT was extraordinarily expensive (my insurance doesn't cover it) so I haven't gone back. Any thoughts or advice? I love to bike and would love to start doing long rides regularly. It's breaking my heart that I can't get my knees straight."

0,In other words the CIA happened.,"Pakistani here! In the 60s, we were very progressive. Free market economy, thriving banking sector, largely secularist (Alcohol, clubbing and everything was part of society). Then the cold war happened. In the mid 70s Prime Minister Bhutto, a socialist, was forced to outlaw alcohol by pressure from the Islamic clergy. He gave in to several other of their demands and that's when the left begun to fall. Bhutto was also anti American, opting to ally himself with the Soviets and China. So naturally, when the Shah (Pro US) was overthrown in Iran by the Shia religious faction (Anti US and Saudi), it was time for Bhutto to bite the dust. The US helped the then Chief of Army Zia ul Haq to take power and ousted Bhutto. Bhutto was hanged shortly afterwards. Now Zia was super Islamist and nationalist. And the US wanted to deter Soviet influence in the then Socialist Republic of Afghanistan. So then came the Afghan Jihad. The US and Pakistan Army started the Al Qaeda and the Taliban to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan. To strengthen this, massive nationalistic and Islamist propaganda and policies were introduced. This included lashing in public, making it mandatory to wear Islamic clothing (people wore western before the 80s), making it mandatory to learn government dictated Islamic studies and Pakistan studies (wasn't even a subject in school before this) and all sorts of policies to radicalize the masses. He also introduced heavy Islamic laws such as blasphemy and sharia. Basically, Pakistan went from being bad to worse in the 80s to pump propaganda and control the masses. The cold war ended, the US left and in the 90s, Pakistan was left in shambles with a radicalized public and a poor economy. When Musharraf came to power in 1999, he introduced liberal and free market policies. Bless that man otherwise Pakistan would be a complete shithole like Iraq or Afghanistan now. Today, urban Pakistan is progressive and liberal whilst rural Pakistan is still Islamist and radicalized. Issue is, it's difficult to de-radicalize two generations of people indoctrinated with religious and nationalistic propaganda in the rural areas while it was very easy to do so in the urban areas within a decade where people have access to free media and western education. So there's a rift in Pakistan now. Rural folks see urban folks as *shameless* and westernized whilst urban folks look at them as backward and blame them for pulling the country back."

""The myth of The Mittani, King of the Fuccbois..."" ""Tell me Grandpa!"" ""Alright little JEFFRAIDER, I'll tell you. Get tucked in and I'll start"" ""There once was a boy named The Mittani. Now, Mittens, (thats what his mom called him), didn't have too many friends growing up. He learned at age 16 of this magical invention called a 'computer'. And on this device he could do anything he wanted, play games, become a wizard, or just be a shitbird. He chose to play games, be a wizard, AND a shitbird, all at the same time. He started this alliance known as 'Goonswarm Federation', to topple the current peace-loving owners of the sandbox, 'Band of Brothers'. He succeeded in doing so, but in the process his mental state was altered. His mother had lost her mittens, and the little boy she loved once previously. All he did was tell her to fuck off and go die. As a result mittens was disowned, and kicked out of his home. He was an outcast, until he met a tribe of Afrikkan men, for mittens lived in Uganda you see, and they taught him the ways of the 'fuccboi', a once thought lost art. He then returned to his old place of residence, and his mother tried with all her might to vanquish him from her home, holy water, the cross, everything. But Mittens was too stronk. His wizard hat had grown exponentially in power, and he cast the spell of transmogrify on his dearest mother, a spell he had learned whilst learning in the League of Fuccbois. She was turned into an Aeon, and transported into his ship hangar. Some say she still lives there today, waiting to exact her revenge on the son that had betrayed her, but some say its all myth! That the powers of the Fuccboi never really existed. That Mittens is just a lie, and its really just CCP Manifest trying to take EVE for himself. As for me? I believe she exists. She'll bring forth the reckoning of that shitbird's wizard hat, and his powers of the fuccboi. But when you may ask? Well that is a story for another time young one. Sleep now, and sleep safe. o7.""

And tbh, I don't think this patch is gonna make a big shift. It is before TI, and big meta shifts always come after TI. I doubt the rubberband gets changed or any big mechanic. It is gonna be more likely OP hero nerfs, item tweaks, and so on.

I can and often have rescued techs I know from the front line idiocy of my co-workers, doing things like un-jamming printers and restoring desktop icons. Ok, I admit, I may be a KED user (Knows Enough to be Dangerous), but nothing had gone yup in smoke yet. At work today, or computers were finally upgraded to Windows 7. We all come in to new log in screens, and one tired tech prepared to help each of us do the final network setups that require our individual log ins. We are handed a printout with instructions on how to access our major program, which is now on a remote server instead of every single machine. We are not told to read the hand out. I go about re-building my desktop. Find the link to the time keeping app and put a shortcut on the desktop. Open up outlook, which automatically sets itself up based on how I'm logged in. Go through the handout and access ImportantProgram. I overhear TeamLead and Supervisor talking about fixing times since people can't clock in, so I go over: Me: I can help! I can put the link to ClockIn back on their desktops. TeamLead: What? You can clock in? Me: Sure, and help them find ImportantProgram and email.. Supervisor: Oh I don't think you should have messed with that. The tech guy is here to help us get set up, I hope you didn't break anything. Stop messing with that and go do Menial Task. Me: But... They're shortcuts... If it had been the tech telling me to knock it off, sure. There are lots of network and security things I don't know. But I followed directions I was handed! And made a shortcut and clicked 'next' six times! TL;DR computers are SCARY don't touch anything at all on them until the tech says you can. Not even with printed instructions."

However, I recognize that a lot have things have changed since I was in college. If I felt it of great consequence I would have edited it. Doing THAT is bullshit. I have flaws and was being conversational. The point is that I demolished 2 people's lives, have managed to track it 12 years later and this was instinct alone. I offered a couple of 3rd pary nuggets up as well. You just showed me something very valuable. You are insecure. You will let out REAL personal items to tuck away. You need approval. In the real world SE doesn't come with a warning. I KNOW the guy you are. I am aware of my ego. You are exactly right though about detail, but you HAD to show you knew better than me. You are sloppy, quick to react, unable to be think through the need for immediate gratification. A few cruises around Reddit are more than enough to start a decent profile on you. You are a liability. I was just sharing in a way I wish people did. I would be glad to be vulnerable and frank on here for a reason. You were both and had I chosen not to call you out, you would have moved on. Flattery. I would go with flattery. Use an alternative handle and giggle about how right you are. How dumb am I for ""-------'''? You would answer and probably call me a liar, but at least something more extreme than this. I would confirm my knee jerk thought and catch you on another SR. Once I understood your need for confirmation, I would write a post saying something innoculous, but misspelled and w bad punctuation. ""Dude, your stupid!"" You would slam me for using the wrong punctuation. Why? Why did you just show how vulnerable you are? I really don't care, it is the weakness you have that can be hammered. I personally would sit on it. But I could make a solid guess to whether you are insecure and a weakling- or maybe just a bully. If you began to pick on someone for a quick laugh, then I might dig in. I own the fact that it was a sloppy post. You have no idea what that means. A disorganized mind? Maybe. A broken keyboard? Maybe. Looking for targets? Maybe. I am aware and focused enough to know why. Do you have a good reason why you couldn't just have said ""You ramble a lot bro""? Hypothetical. Of course you don't. There was no personal malice in my post. I PUT in the header that I have been watching. Surely there are many people that feel the same way. I am none the wiser. Like I said, you're a liability. The worst b/c it is undisciplined, multi faceted and you had to also correct me as well as try and shame. There is no morality or even common sense involved. You attacked the format. Not the content. Dropping Cunt was like Xmas though. 99% chance of something. You will have to work to figure it out."

However, PS4 has a slightly higher overall player base due to system sales. But for ESO, are there more people playing it on PS4 or Xbox One? Most forums I go to have more people chatting about the Xbox One version. Also most Twitch streams I see are showing the Xbox One version.

Period. I know this has been beaten like a dead horse but it's true 100%. P2P based games are not the way to get this done. Anyone see the movie Gamer? Well Terry Crews slaughters people because there is no Ping. Same theoretical idea here. The rage that is coming from the networking errors as well as DDoS and DC's is real and prominent. Dedicated servers would not only alleviate many of these networking issues but would also pave a much smoother path to wield the ban hammer for those who are only in it for themselves and try to break the system. It also does confuse me that if you get kicked they can show you an error code but if you just leave you leave. Therefore there MUST be some sort of way to differentiate the ones who get kicked vs the ones who hold up ghost and hold down ""Y"" or ""triangle (PSN)"" I guess? TL;DR Bungie needs dedicated servers in order to keep ToO alive as well as be more adamant about weeding the bad seeds out."

You won't exactly be an 'off tank' with this spec, but you should be the highest damage dealer in you party. Depending on how you spec you can either be more upfront (but still kinda squishy) or totally specialize in being an a more sneaky assassin type. Off tank dps is more the realm of two handed warriors (or sword and shield warriors specced for damage which can be quite effective in the roll too). The reason for this is one of mechanics, warriors can have 'guard' to off tank instead of losing health and naturally higher health to begin with, rouges on the other hand have more of the avoid getting hit in the first place skills."

First off this game is very fun to play, you got the quests with just simple instructions telling you what to do and you do it and it works, its amazing. I'm likin the feeling of being lost all the time but there is been a few things thats bin buggin me -What the fuck is what all the bloody hate for mooon sugar and the skooma, damn every merchant be like naw mate, you gotta remove the sugar first. Naw man I needs the skooma. - Talkin about the Nords, why some nords like that outlaw outside Hola Od(that coast village near balmora) be like super strong. You got the simple enemy, thinking the dungeon be easy and then bam you see the fucking Nord be knocking you down and be taking you out in like 2 fucking hits. Not fair if you ask me. - Where do I get one of them fancy longblades, all I keep seeing is cool shortswords with fancy effects while I got a simple sword with no effect, just a sword. Where do I get them higher level swords? - How do I make it up to Fargoth, I feel like I screwed him over for that 100 gold and he aint even do nothing wrong and now I got like fucking 7k. - IS there a seller in the game that has some gold, I stole me some of the fancy soul gems when the khajit at the mages guild told me to switch out the gem. ythy were just sittin there, figures why not take some. One of them is like 60k value, its crazy. - Whats with these damn assasins, fuking hell man why they keep attacking me, theres nothing in the journal, I got no quests about them or anything, what did I miss.]. Every now and then I be resting and these fuckers keep popping up. I killed one and I took its armor but mate it was too fucking strong. Like I had chitin armor and it was12 armor and then the assasins armor was like 40 something. It made no sense to me, cause none of them other armors was that good,, wtf. So I was doin the dungeon and I realized I was not taking damage so I left the armor and went back to chittin and now I die again. - Whats with them cliffracers, yo they be breaking my immersion by just freezing in the air and fucking getting stuck on everything. I just wanna fight the fucker but naw now he stuck and I got to shimmy around till I can get the hits, complete bullshit. - I dont understand personality, I got he lady gift man and it give me super personality but what it do man? like I still gotta bribe people, no body divulging any secrets, but everyone know about solstheim though. Also how I increase it - So I got my destruction quite high cause I be using it yeah but I barely got restoration, like all my restoration spells have a 71 percent chance of passing while the dstruction is 100. How I restoration up if I barely use it and why is it 71 and not a 100, its major skill man. - Why no silt strider in Pelgaid? - HOw I free them prisoners at dren plantation cause I see no dialogue option, I tell you man that 65 personality aint do shit. -I got a quest, I broke into this manor in balmora and the dude was dead but its all good, though he had a slave and that was a bit wierd. Like why aint she leave yet/ Ayway she tells me the murdderer description and I go around town asking for it. I find out its the dude at council club, but there is a problem yeah. I killed all the people in the council club cause some dude at some fort was like you need to kill the bad people and they was enemy #1 for bros at theives guild so I did what was necessary. What do I do with the quest now? - Its cool right like if you join all the guilds and shit, like there no conflict between them right? - HOw I make the potion, I mean the good ones like I dont want no bloody 2 health, like I want the quality ones. How I make them, I read that book ingame but it doesn't give no recipes just what each plant do. - DO items stay where you drop them the entire game, I dropped a sword in balmora like when I got there and its still there. - I joined the imperial cult but where do I get the quests? - I got an issue, sometime I be explloring and I come upon a location and I feel that the location dont have much to offer much but its probably used for later. Like those tombs, should I just raid them or wait for a quests. Like is every location/dungeon used in a game for a quests or are there location which are meant to be stumbled upon and thats it. - Ahnaasi is a friend"

Just as an interesting side thread on a Sunday evening, where did everyone's usernames come from? What inspired them, what do they mean, when did you come up with it? All that good stuff. Mine for example was something I came up with at about the age of 10 or so, when I took an interest in the meaning behind my name. The ""Fair"" part came from my surname, which is Gaelic and means ""Fair-haired"" or ""Courageous"", which was oddly suiting considering I'm blond. The ""Wolf"" part comes from my forename, which is also Gaelic, and means ""Lover of Hounds"" or ""Lover of Wolves"". Wolves are cool and all I guess. Hence, took those two, switched them around, and thus was born my username, which I've used on basically everything since I came up with it. How about everyone else?"

Now the reverse has happened - Intel went back to P3 and derived from there to make Core and succeeded in making good silicon and started gaining ground again, then AMD made bulldozer which shot themselves in the foot (its good in server market - massive multitasking, but bad in enthusiast market - per core perf is poor) and so Intel has most of the high end market back."

I like them better than premium haggendaz type brands for half the price. And lots of the time they go on sale for buy two for $7 which still rings up just $3.50 per full half gallon. These sales are kinda random, last for a week, sometimes two weeks in a row. My favorite is their chocolate chip cookie dough.

I am a 36 year old family man with a steady job (12 years experience) in an oil &amp; gas company. But I've always had the desire/dream to put a business of my own. I've had a number of ideas for different things but all of them had a downside I wouldn't accept. Now I have an idea I am very happy to move forward with and I strongly believe in it. I have experience in Sales, project management and contracts but I lack the technical knowledge/experience to code/develop my idea. However, I have funds that I am willing and able to sink in to get someone to develop the idea. The idea is to create an online classifieds website with a twist. The twist would mean there are no competitors in Australia. My plan is to start small with an MVP (beta version) for Australia and only in one of the states/territories. And then scale up (grow Australia-wide and add functionality/plugins as the users base grows. So it needs to be developed so the webpage can be scale up if its a success. I would like to know: -Should I contact a Web developing company or an individual web developer? (The webpage would need regular tweeks as I envision it to have additional plugins as the traffic grows. So I would prefer to have a strong relationship/partnership with a web developer. Potentially offer a small percentage of the companies equity.) Pros/Cons? -I don't want to sign NDA with every web developer/company I speak with but I also want to shop around to make sure I get the best person at a fair price. What experience/qualifications would I look for in the web developer/companies I speak with? -Any other comments?"

It looks like it contains enough extras to fill in the gaps, like the 1.5u left control, 1.5u key to the right of the spacebar, and the four extra keys, the two blank blue keys, the blue fn, and the blank grey key, could be used for the 1u sized windows buttons, app button, and menu button.

So I sat down at my table with my friends (there was no seating chart). I'd like to point out that all of these people were guys and I was a girl. They were in a deep discussion about Pokemon and what was super effective on what. The oldest of our group, let's call him Greg, claimed that Grass types were super effective on Ice types. Everyone else had agreed. This made me very mad for some reason, so I started to play with my shirt as I quietly began to state my opinion; that that wasn't the case. Another one of my friends, I'll call him James, was cutting over me; they had already moved on in the conversation. But me being the self-appointed Pokemon guru of the group, I couldn't allow their error in Pokelogic to go uncorrected. I got very angry as they continued to ignore me and, suddenly, I bit down on my shirt and yanked it upward, causing the shirt to make a audible rip straight down the middle. Suddenly my usually boisterous group had gone silent, shock and embarrassment lighting their faces. I just stared blankly at them for a moment, slowly beginning to realize what I had just done. I then spotted the teacher making a bee line towards me. Oh shit oh shit oh shit... I quickly hold my shirt together and then preceded to leave. I had no spare shirts, so I camped out in the girl's bathroom until my sister came across me by chance. TLDR? I was hanging out with friends, one made an incorrect statement about Pokemon, I got so mad I ripped my shirt open."

As well as a injured Koscielny and not a fully fit Walcott. What are you meant to do in that situation? Imagine those players missing from any other team. Then on to the game itself. It's such fine margins. Before the goal I didn't really think we were doing to bad. I don't think Southampton were better than us. If Cazorla puts that chance in and Szczesny doesn't cock up twice, It's a different game. Those are individual errors. Let alone the deserved red card.

0,"Between hearing Farmers presser today and listening to Bull and Fox afterwards, looks like Johnny will be starting next year.","News Flash: Johnny is our future QB Simple as that. All I see on here is ""Hoyer Hoyer Hoyer. OMG stop talking about Johnny, ESPN!"" People are interested in Johnny. Whether you like it or not, people talk about him. And as much as people deny it, they like hearing about him and they want to see him play. Chances are, Johnny won't play this year. But I'd bet my life he's the starter game one of next season. Hoyer hasn't been playing lights out like everyone around here likes to claim. He's doing fine. He's a fine QB. But he's not the answer. He's winning games for now and that's great and I love watching the Browns win. But coming into this stretch of tough games I'd be surprised if we finish above .500. How many of you think we're going to win a super bowl with Hoyer under center? Probably no one. Johnny has the higher ceiling. Johnny is more likely to be a franchise QB than Hoyer. And that's why we'll see Johnny next year. The only thing more annoying than ESPN sucking off Johnny is people around here trashing him like he's an enemy. He's a teammate. And the best chance at a franchise QB we have."

As we get close i warn my cousin of the upcoming impact and we just miss the tree line over the island and bam! We hit the ground hard the rotor snaps and we roll into a tree, bringing our spinning adventure to and end.

Okay, so this didn't happen today, but it was recent. So there I was, walking down the street, when a wild stray cat appears. It starts rubbing my feet and, since I love cats, I pet it. Suddenly, a pack of third graders appears from nowhere and threatens me with a large wooden stick for petting their cat. Now, the cat was clearly stray and had no collar, so it wasn't my fault. I told them this, and they started letting loose some colorful language. I decided to tell their parents what they were saying, and on my way to their house (everyone in the neighborhood knew where each other lived), I was hit in the back with a rock. I turned around and ducked just as a rock flew above my head. Those goddamn kids were throwing rocks at me, so I declared war and charged. Most of the kids were intimidated (I'm a 9th grader), but two dumb-looking ones (one of whom was holding the stick) held their ground and continued throwing rocks. While I charged, I was hit by two rocks, but I continued running. I leaped on one of the kids and punched him in the face, and he started crying. The one carrying the stick ran away, dropping it in the process. I turned around to leave, but I heard him get up. My instincts made me grab the stick, do a spin attack, and make him fall to the ground. He was crying and screaming at this point, partly due to the fact that blood was spilling out of his eye. I'll admit that I wasn't thinking straight, but whatever. The kid raised his arms, begging for mercy, but I thought he was trying to hit me, so I SMASHED his tiny hand with the stick. There was this sickening CRUNCH sound as I noticed that the thumb was dangling lifelessly from it's socket. Rather than help the kid, I ran away. The cat followed me. The kid told his parents that I did it, but I had a reputation as an incredibly peaceful and nice kid, while everyone knew that he was a brutal and reckless delinquent, so nobody believed him. The blame was shifted to one of his friends, who was grounded for two weeks, from what I hear. A week later, I confessed to my parents and they were mad but didn't really do anything. When my parents told the grounded kid's parents that it was me, he was ungrounded. At school the next day, he found me and kicked me in the shin. I feigned pain to make it up to him for framing him. TL;DR: was attacked by gang of third graders because I petted a cat, defended myself by brutally maiming one of them, framed a kid."

When I told my friend I was quitting WoW (WoD was boring me) to return to ESO once it went free-to-play, I was given a 15 minute lecture on how the game wouldn't last, what it didn't have, what it needed, why it would fizzle out quickly, ect. Another friend of mine, an Elder Scrolls fan at that, thinks the game is ""absolutely horrible"" and hasn't even tried it out. I get it, you know? This game isn't for everyone. Not everyone is going to like a particular game, and I get that. The game was rocky at launch, and the monthly fee didn't help its case. It appeals to specific players, and some gamers aren't going to be a fan of it for whatever reason. But I'll be damned if I can figure out why this game is so universally hated. There's games that get vitriol thrown their way all the time, but people just...blindly hate this game with seemingly no real reason for it. I know a few people who don't care for the slow leveling, which is understandable. But everyone else? The reason seems to be, ""Because it's not an Elder Scrolls Game/Because it's horrible."" There's just a surprising amount of people who just harbor a deeply rooted, malicious hatred for this game and are determined to spread it to as many others as possible."
0,Caffiene = loss of grammar in b0und.,"an analysis of call of duty from caffeine at 2 a.m. that is cross posted from r/codaw well, before I get started, a long tangent is in bound, that I just put together in some reply to a comment because I think to much and had to much coffee today. I will be pointing out things about dedicated servers, match making systems, peer 2 peer connections, game balancing and game design. I will most likely express a ton of unpopular opinions in this piece but I kind of want to see what the COD community thinks of it. but let me start off about the match making dynamics; the way call of duty games make and shape their lobbies and matches is out dated or at least needs some fine tuning, I will go far enough to admit that is a reasonable thing to be frustrated about, peer 2 peer is a terrible system that shouldn't be implemented unless they figure out a way to communicate less information per a lobby, and since there is so much information floating around each lobby being stored with the host it causes so much lag, even people like me who have this amazing comcast internet and every thing is hard wired in get screwed over because John in Kansas can't connect his ps4 to his modem because hes 16 and his dad is an ass hole, who doesn't want a 150 ft. cat6E Ethernet cable running along his walls. servers would make sense, but given the way servers are designed it would essentially effect the system activision has set up for the call of duty series as it is and has been since cod3 and cod4 changed the game, people rotate to new call of duty titles every year or every two years, (now it might be 3 because 3 teams are making the games). how would it ever be cost efficient to host servers for a game that realistically has a life cycle of 8-10 months of major activity? another logical route would be to put the ability to build servers into the hands of the players, but they can't do that because it ruins their multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) formula where people play with the specific guidelines handed to them. and then you get to things like skill based matchmaking, which is like communism, it sounds great on paper, but in effect is a hot mess of garbage. the actual problems with skill based match making that go beyond connection and ping capability are how easily it makes it for a developer. in that system you can make unbalanced guns, unbalanced maps and even unbalanced physics because every one is playing at the same teir, even if john is more skilled then Kat, so even if people have different play styles, their capabilities and styles are going to similar more often then not, I actually get excited when some one has a pyrat equipped, its honestly lazy development in a nut shell. I will admit that paragraph is a stretch and mostly just my personal opinion, because there are pros and cons to SBMM, it creates a better gaming environment for the lobby when it is in ideal conditions, its why every usually has great games around the time block of 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. but the cons are how broken it makes the game for people who are there for fun like me, I will boldly admit cal of duty is my guilty pleasure in my circles of friends since we all grew up playing quake, CS1.7 and such together, I will also boldy state I rarely find the game challenging and often struggle to take it seriously, I got side tracked. the most disturbing thing for me is how unbalanced aw is compared to so many other titles, cod has always been a hot mess of no balancing but its been livable, I rarely see any one using heavy weapons or shot guns these days. they shouldn't try to balance it out though, its not actually broken because of its imbalance and a common negative misconception is how that is bad for the games, when it can bring a new level of challenge to the title, using a pyrat and mastering it is an art form. the game design is something bugs me, they put so much effort into the textures, the realism around you through visuals that it takes away the play-ability of the game. dying light is a good comparison to this, even though it looks beautiful, I have to point out that I can climb on basically anything in that game, and jump over so many things. after a weekend long dying light binge I moved onto aw for dblexp gg and became annoyed by the limited mobility of the maps and the game. as far as it goes they are great games, but man, people need to step back and just play the video game, this isn't star craft and we are not in taiwan (or whatever country that was) if you care a lot and want an environment that is serious, call of duty might not be your cup of tea and I would recommend moving over to games with a group, like CSGO or battle fields titles(on pc) where people seem to take things a lot more seriously. other then that, this tangent lost its momentum because its two hours after I drank all that coffee."

0,"If Hulk Hogan could do it, Ryback can.","Ryback will never make it and be ""the man"", he's just not good enough. I am not saying this solely because of the CM Punk rib incident, but ever since his return I have not been impressed. They've rehashed his initial debut where he comes and does a bunch of power moves. However, he's still poor in the ring. Unlike Goldberg, the dude does not have the same intensity with his moves. And unlike Roman Reigns who the IWC will say cannot do singles wrestling, he does not have that ""it"" factor to him. My point is there have been plenty of ""average wrestlers"" who made it huge like Mick Foley or The Rock, but those guys had other things going for them. Ryback is just a generic powerhouse dressed up a bit. Mind you Ryback has been wrestling for damn near 9-10 years. And the dude still sucks shit. Ryback could have a long career as a perennial mid-carder who does the big tag matches, fights the current babyface or heel, but I don't think he'll ever be a World champion. Especially with the dirtsheets reporting that the Triple H match has been cancelled, I'm thinking the company will focus more on Reigns, Ambrose, Rollins, and Ziggler. I will get downvoted to hell because this subreddit loves DA BIG GUY, but whatever."

0,You don't deserve a pet.,"Me with my BF together for 6 yrs, empty threats toward my cat Lived together for 2 years and together for 6. We get along really well and love each other alot. My bf (Frank) and I have had our differences, but nothing we haven't been able to get through. We've learned how to fight productively which I think is a really important. The one thing that still bothers me though, is his hatred toward my cat. I've had my cat (Stinker) for nearly a decade. I love him to bits, but he pees on things and does normal annoying cat stuff. Frank loves dogs. Frank hates cats. He's only put up with Stinker because I told him that the cat and I were a package deal. That doesn't stop him from complaining about Stinker all the time though. Although I'm not a huge cat person, I've had Stinker so long I'm kind of attached to him. And I know his age and his actions would make him pretty unadoptable so I could never imagine giving him up to a shelter. I've been trying to find a good home for him for awhile, but, like I said, he's not the easiest cat to get along with so it's been difficult. The biggest problem is the few times that Frank has really worried me with his words and actions toward Stinker. For the most part, it's just normal complaints and sometimes he even snuggles or pets Stinker when he's in a good mood. But here are the examples I'm referring to: 1. We have to keep him in the basement when we leave so he doesn't pee on the carpet. A few times when we first moved in together, when Frank was wrangling Stinker into the basement, Frank picked up Stinker and Stinker scratched his arms. In response, Frank pretty much threw Stinker into a wall. I got really upset both times and told him that was completely unacceptable. It hasn't happened since but it's still in my memory. 2. Sometimes, he'll make threats toward Stinker to me. Like, if I'm not at home he'll text me and say something like ""Next time your cat pees on the carpet I'm going to throw him out of the house and leave him there."" Stinker is an indoor cat and never goes outside. The thing that makes me not TOO worries about this stuff is that he is actually really supportive about Stinker when it gets right down to it. Stinker got bit by a visiting dog a few years ago and needed a small surgery. Frank was extremely supportive and loaned me money to help take care of him and was very concerned about his recovery. He also lets me know when Stinker runs out of food or water or anything so I can take care of him. This is what makes me feel like they are empty threats. My question to you is - What can we do about this situation until I am able to rehome Stinker? And should I be worried about future animals we may get or do you think this is just a cat-related situation? Although they aren't my favorite, I'm not really a cat hater. I could be way off and Frank could be stressed about something else and it's just manifesting as getting annoyed with Stinker. Or maybe I'm the stressed one and I'm just reading too much into the situation. I don't know. Any advice would be appreciated. **tl;dr**: My bf is sometimes nice and sweet to my cat but has several times threatened the cat and has been way too rough with him. Not sure how to proceed."

It cost him an alliance with the Ironborn and it cost him Walder Frey loyalty. Walder craved respect more than anything. To be told that he had broken his marriage pact by raven? what an insult. Robb should have waited to marry the girl (or not married her at all) he should have called for his father in law to be an advisor, hand to the king, flattered him but also winkled him out of his castle. Then you tell him about it, you tell him how you need HIM too break the marriage pact to save your honour and blah blah blah, throw in the bribe of a marriage with your uncle, maybe a couple of castles for lesser sons. In private and telling him first, he had to hear about it third hand, knowing the blackwoods and brackens and half the riverlands were laughing at him. That's what caused him to switch sides, it wasn't logic, it was shame, it was wrath. One of Robb big mistakes here is if you are trying to make up for something you have to offer something the same value or more, you can't take away a marriage to a king and give back a marriage to a lord, that's an insult."

You'll notice at no point does he seem to indicate that he is in any way interested in spending his wealth. The character is supposed to be greedy, and that doesn't just mean getting money. It means that he keeps the money he gets, too. I imagine Kakuzu as an incredibly cheap individual. He doesn't horde money so he can spend it. He hordes it so that it's his. His greed isn't about currency, it's about control. This is further highlighted by the greedy way he steals others hearts so that he may live forever. He is a control freak who is just out to horde as much as he can. He's not interested in using anything he takes, really. It only matters that it's his."

Brother you should read Amin Ahsan Islahi, an expert in Quranic rhetoric and eloquence who observes: ""If you ponder over this tradition, it seems from every angle the fabrication of a hypocrite. Its purpose is to cast doubt upon the authenticity of the Quran, and to create suspicion in unsuspecting hearts that some verses have been excluded from the Quran. Consider first of all, its language. Can anyone with good taste accept it as a Quranic ayah? It is impossible for any with sound academic taste to even attribute it to the Prophet let alone attribute it a Quranic verse."" Islahi, vol. 5, pages 366-367 Therefore the sermon should be rejected in Islam. May Allah guide us all to the right path."

0,"Sry m8, no satchel for you.","Healers and Satchel Rewards The whole point in Call to Arms is to actually **REWARD** players for queuing in a role that is in high demand. As a healer who has absolutely no need to run heroics any longer, I'm crazy frustrated with this reward system. Before I explain why, let's elaborate on why most over-geared tanks and healers will queue for a heroic dungeon. Alts. Plain and simple. The only reason I queue up is to be able to get a satchel that I can give to my under-geared dps alt so that I don't have to go through the pain and agony of heroics as a low ilvl all over again. I am, in Blizzard's design, HELPING the situation by removing another low level dps from their huge pool of queued players, and instead replacing that with a highly in demand role that is OP and will actually be of benefit to the group and compensate for their low item level (I probably dps 50% of the time I run a heroic with my resto shaman). So, here is where the frustration kicks in. We all know the lovely situation where you queue up, the satchel is a listed reward, and you instantly get queued with a group. But then, mid dungeon, someone decides to drop group, and the only reason you queued in the first place is gone. Tanks, you get off easier. 9 times out of 10 the tank I'm with will still get the Call to Arms reward after we have been re-queued. As a healer though? No dice. Blizzard's answer when I have asked? ""We have no way of verifying if the reward was available at the time you were queued and therefore can not award you the item (said item being a Satchel of Savage Mysteries). So here are my choices: 1) As soon as someone drops group, drop as well so you don't get the deserter debuff and try again when the rewards are available. You better be fast though, because if someone else hits the re-queue button before you leave, enjoy your 30 minute ""time out"" even though you weren't the reason the group broke up. I personally don't like this option because, quite frankly I'm upset with the dick who dropped group in the first place, so I'm not going to hypocritically do the same thing. 2) Spend 20 to 30 minutes, depending on the dungeon (I'm looking at you UBRS), completing the dungeon that will award me absolutely no benefits whatsoever. I don' t need the gold, the random greens, or the admiration or thanks from complete strangers who wound up in my group. The reason I queued was because I was offered a reward. Before the haters start hating, WoW is based on reward systems. Everything you do in WoW is for the promise of a reward; a new level, a new pet, a new piece of gear, a new achievement. How hard is this to fix? Honestly? It's a simple matter of flagging if the reward was offered **at the time the role was queued** and then ensuring the dungeon is run to completion. To those that would answer ""Roll a tank if you want to farm satchels"" my answer is this: I hate tanking. I have a tank, a warrior, that I leveled so that I could broaden my experience as a healer to understand what was going on on the other side of the coin. Tanking is not something I enjoy, I enjoy healing. And quite frankly, the reward is offered to healers, therefore I should be able to reap said reward in the role I enjoy playing that, according to Call to Arms, is **in demand**.

GET AN ADDON THAT TRACKS YOUR AUTO ATTACKS. Killing machine is proced only by auto attacks, if you track when they are coming you will totally avoid clipping the proc by using the wrong ability. This works for 2h and 1h although it's about twice as effective for 2h because of the slower auto attacks. Simply put the bar right in the middle of your screen and look at it before you cast FS if you're 2h and obliterate if you're 1h. If you're about to auto, hold off for a sec to see if you proc KM. If you don't proc, spam until next auto comes up. This will guarantee that you get optimal use of your KM procs."

And one by one...they start eating each other until there are only two left. The two survivors. And then what? Do you kill them? No. You take them and release them into the trees, but now they don't eat coconut anymore. Now, they only eat rat."

0,Take the clothes pin apart and paint it with old nail polish.,"TIFU and got a splinter in my clitoris Before I start, I want to apologize to any other girls who may cringe at this story. I know that not everyone likes to get their vajayjay smacked up like I do. Okay, first off, don't think I'm weird! Like 99% of fetishes are based in pain, so it's totally normal. So, yeah, I'm really into getting my labia treated roughly. Punched, kneed, whatever. It hurts a lot, and I love it. I'd never do anything extreme enough to cause destruction, though. Despite it all, I'm very protective of my lady-zone. Over the past few years, I've discovered that I'm really into putting a clothespin on my clitoris when I masturbate. Yesterday, I decided to enjoy myself as usual. But, when I took the clothespin off, the pain lingered longer than I expected. It was really unpleasant. I decided to inspect the area, and there it was: A big, nasty splinter, mercilessly spearing my precious pearl. I tried to pick it out, but it wasn't coming. I was still pretty wet, and it made the whole thing slippery. I felt like I was trying to free the legendary sword in the stone. But I didn't need to become the king of England. I just wanted a wood-free clitoris. It su-uuucked. I was rolling on the bathroom floor, bloody toilet paper strewn about, with an unyielding chunk of wood impaling my delicate little nub, and it wasn't going anywhere. I felt like I'd been skewered straight through my body like a shish kabob, and I could feel it up in my damn throat. I fiddled with the tweezers as I prayed to any gods that may be listening to remove this horror from my lady-button. Finally, somehow, I managed to grip the little bastard and yanked it straight out. At last, the clitpocalypse was over. I iced that shit up for a while afterward. I've been walking around with a handful of cotton down the front of my panties ever since, but I think my little one is going to make a full recovery. :3 I'm going to lay off the rough stuff, though."

If I had been anybody else, I mean anybody else would have retired. For me to get in there, put the work in, everybody knows I got hand problems. They say I don't have any power, well I got enough power that I break my hands every time I fight. So I've had to rely on my boxing skills and my ring intelligence, ring generalship, and that's where I really show what caliber of fighter I am. Everyone was making Broner out to be the next big thing, and he couldn't knock me down or out. I was outboxing him, I put a clinic on him, and then we saw the Haymon influence come up. Split decision. Well we all know what a split decision looks like with a Haymon fighter. We saw that with Mickey Bey on the undercard of Mayweather-Maidana II and more recently with the Escandon-Cave debacle on ESPN. Broner never took my girl. Jessica wasn't my girl, just something I had going on for a while. She didn't even know my mother's name.

They would of been of those people who run around and seem to do nothing. I don't understand why it's so hard to figure out and play properly?

0,It says its the final installment on the IndieDB page.,"theory about ""the final chapter"" so as we know, FNaF 4's subtitle is ""the final chapter"" but is it REALLY the final game? First let's not look in-game, but in real life. Scott Cawthon has made thousands of hundreds of dollars off of the FNaF series, would he really put it down? Now, I know what you might be thinking, ""but FNaF 4 might be the answer to everything we need to know"" but what if it isn't? What if we're left without answers after FNaF 4? I think that there is a slim chance of a 5th game. FNaF has had one prequel so far, that being FNaF 2. And now FNaF 4, the final chapter. The last in the timeline. I might even say, ""the end of the book"" but in a book, you can jump around, it's confusing. seriously. I tried it once. Don't. It's as confusing as the game's lore can be. so could there be another prequel after FNaF 4? What do you think?"

0,Are you a sex therapist?,"About 2-3 inches in is where the nerve endings are that produce that ""stretch"" feeling. If a woman was laying down, stomach up, then the G Spot is the ""ceiling"". Hitting that with your tip (also 2-3 inches in) and gliding the top trying to poke out the stomach will usually produce a ""shallow"" feeling, as the nerves go from dense to sparse as you penetrate. Go the opposite way, entering from the ceiling and penetrating the floor, then glide back trying to poke out of the lower back. This will usually produce a ""deeeeeep"" feeling of penetration because the most flexible, stretchy skin is in this area and you will produce a ""filling"" sensation during penetration. The common mistake most of us guys make is thinking that actual depth of penetration is required to feel ""deep"", it isn't. The G spot (ceiling) and cervix (back wall) are rigid, the skin on the ""floor"" is what you can stretch out during penetration and give a ""filling up"" feeling. YMMV, but try it on your partner. Do a position where you are standing and she is lying down, on a bed or table. Enter low and thrust skyward, trying to ""poke out of her belly button"". This would be a G Spot thrust. Then spread her legs, place a large pillow or two under her lower back so that her hips and shoulders are forced to curve around it, scoot up towards her face, and enter with as much ""toward her lower back"" direction as possible. This should give a very ""deep"" penetrating feeling for her."

The ticket is for $125 but if I pay it I am admitting guilt to a petty class b misdemeanor. The other option is going to court and hopefully convincing the court to dismiss the charges in lieu of a fine. I have spoken to many lawyers and have gotten so much different information. This is most likely going to cost me over $3,000 and there is still no guarantee that this will not go on my criminal record. 300 yards down the beach and this would have cost me $100. Darn.

Should I just leave my name in the church because it doesn't really matter? Or if I do opt to resign, what can I expect to happen? Will all of my old ward friends find out? Do they tell people you are resigning? I would really just like a little more info on what to expect should I resign and why I should or why I should just not worry about it? Thanks!"
0,Hmmm I wonder how much debt those owners are actually in.,"The people I have been renting off over the past few years have been rolling in it. I imagine scrooge mcduck-esque style towers filled with money. The last house I was in was owned by one guy who told me very casually that he in fact owned 7 of the 12 three bedroom units in my complex, like it was the most natural thing in the world. He also owned many more properties and offered to move us to one of his other properties when he turfed us out to sell one of his houses. The next house I rented was owned by a couple who told me they owned all four houses (three bedroom, very new and quite nice) which were next to eachother. They also owned many houses in other areas. We pay rent to their company which I assume is to minimise tax. They are very nice people. All my wife and I want is to be able to both get decent long term jobs and buy a house to start our family but it seems so hard. My parents used to tell me how they could walk from one job to another in the same day. My wife graduated 2013 and hasn't been able to find anything but casual work since then. My wage is pathetic (finishing postgraduate study) and we live paycheque to paycheque. I just want a reasonable chance :("

0,"Live however you want, so long as you are not going out of your way to hurt people","Who's right or wrong? Today = 26th birthday. Parents called to say Happy Birthday, and mentioned my Dad had been in the hospital the last 4 days (""BP dropped to 50 over something""). My opinion: They were waiting until I called them to tell me he was in the hospital of course I didn't call. Normally, 1 if not both call once a week &amp; talk for at least 1 or 2 hours. They also throw in a few ""haven't heard from you in awhile"" each conversation. I don't think we HAVE to talk once a week, the truth is they call to #1 check if i'm alive &amp; if i've finally gotten a job which they don't come right out &amp; ask. #2 To tell me same stories over &amp; over. I could record myself saying ""uh huh yea"" &amp; they wouldn't notice. I do ask questions &amp; all that to keep the convo going, but anytime I bring up something they move on very quickly back to their life. #3 Gossip. Last couple years my relationship with my mom has taken a hard hit bc I've stopped for the most part &amp; I try to steer the convo in a better direction. Also I keep my relationship with my husband &amp; his family more guarded than before because whether it's good or bad she can construe something negative from any info. Other crap: My mom always disapproves of something in my life &amp; wants to change it. If I ever fix one thing she finds something else wrong with me. Right now it's a job. I'm a few months shy of 2 years without having a job. In that time my husband &amp; I have moved once to a neighboring state &amp; then we moved across the country. We also remodeled our house &amp; rented it out, while living hours away so I made frequent tips back &amp; forth. We also planned &amp; had our wedding in that time. My parents would ask me almost weekly before getting married about a job. The problem for the most part was my husband &amp; I knew after moving to the neighboring state that it still wan't everything we wanted, so we began planning for the big move but didn't tell people because we didn't know if it would actually work out. My husband &amp; I have had endless talks about this, he makes 95k &amp; enjoys giving me the luxury to stay home, and I enjoy it also. We have started talking about having kids and we are planning trying for a baby in a few months. If not before we have a baby I definitely plan on returning to the work force once kids are in school at the very least. I could understand if he made alot less money my parents pushing me to get a job. Since getting married they haven't come right out &amp; asked but they still dance around the subject or tell me stories of how awful someone is bc they aren't working. I think part of it comes from the fact they both worked to provide for us growing up &amp; didn't have nearly the kind of money we have when they were our age and also they don't want me to be dependent on my husband. Being informed on the phone today he had been in the hospital for 4 days I knew they wanted me to get upset &amp; ask why they didn't call me so they could throw me not calling enough in mine but I was not in the mood to play the game. This does have to be addressed though bc if something did happen &amp; my Mom didn't let me know I could never forgive her. We are an extremely non confrontational family, so when I tell them to call me when something like that happens I know everything will come flooding out about the job stuff so I want to be prepared. My husband &amp; I think me working &amp; our money is our business, especially since we've never asked them for anything in over 6 years. So opinions? Are we crazy for living this way or do they need to just be happy for us?"

As with any competition, there are rules. If you break these rules, you'll be disqualified not just from this week, but the entire contest, so pay attention. ###1. You must be an active member of r/nfl. ###2. Serious predictions only in top comments. Feel free to joke about other's predictions, but please reserve top comments for serious predictions. Failure to do so will result in immediate and irreconcilable disqualification. ###3. Do not edit your comments. Edited comments will not count for the week. ###4. Respect reddiquette. Do not downvote some one's predictions because they picked against your team. ###5. You have until kickoff of the Thursday night game to get your 5 predictions in. Good luck! ###In addition to these rules, I strongly suggest you steer clear from Homer predictions. Your brain picks better than your heart! As always, here are my picks for the week. Last week my big winners were Jets over Steelers and Browns humiliating the Bengals. ###1. The Lions break the mold, wake up from their skid, and finally win a game on Turkey Day. ###2.

We will be a treated to a SECOND Jurassic World trailer at the first commercial break of the Niners and Seahawks game.

If you want to get them asap then be my guest, but that faction and the 1-2e cost of the tomes can be used to get other things...

As much as everyone has trashed the Urick article, and rightfully so, I heard something key in there that I always found interesting. In order to convict someone, you need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt to the jury, you were guilty. What you all are doing now, is in hindsight, off at best a limited and at worst biased podcast, simply trying to poke holes in a partial understanding of a case that has already been established. Something jumped out to me when I saw the 80 alleged alibi witnesses that were not called. Adnan, who has little to no physical evidence against him whatsoever, is being convicted entirely on one mans account, and cell phone records that allegedly match. Here is a popular kid, a well known kid at school, track, the mosque etc. Not only, does this kid have absolutely giant hunks of time completely un accounted for. He can't say for certain where the hell he was at all the key points of this possible murder. Ok, so he was a stoner, he was a kid, were looking at it months later. I get it. Aside from his co-pilot for all the activities, you can't find ONE other person who can account for his whereabouts?? Aside from one girl who changes her story and really isn't sure what day it was, there are just hours of time where absolutely nobody but Jay, allegedly saw him. I mean think about this. I could even half buy it, if he had a half-assed alibi that he was sitting in his car by himself smoking weed and there were no witnesses. What are the chances, that during normal waking hours, on the exact time someone you were accused of murdering was killed and buried, that you as a high school aged kid have absolutely zero accounting for your time, and despite 80 people willing to step up and speak to your character, can account for any of that time either?"

0,Mormonism thrives on bad thinking.,"Mormonism turns some logical fallacies into virtues. It's not just that they use logical fallacies, it's that they turn them into virtues and teach their members to embrace them. These are the ones I thought of. The appeal to authority is a logical fallacy. Authorities get things wrong, and an argument is true or false regardless of its source. Yet in Mormonism you are taught to follow the prophet because of his authority. Some go so far as to say that even if the prophet is wrong, you'll be blessed for following him. Obedience in and of itself, regardless of the morality of the order, is what is important. The appeal to emotion is another one. How a proposition makes you feel is irrelevant to whether it is right or not. Yet in Mormonism, the ability to feel a proposition's truth in your bosom is a spiritual gift. Facts that make you feel good should be accepted. Facts that make you feel bad or dark should be rejected. Ad hominem is where you reject an argument because of some perceived character flaw in the source of the argument. Staying away from anti mormons and anti-mormon material and from apostates (because they are liars and adulterers) is a virtue, with no consideration given that they might have something useful to say. Proof by assertion: you repeatedly restate your claim regardless of contradiction. Mormonism encourages its members to bear their testimony, especially when confronted with doubt or contradiction. It's not about defending the claims, but merely stating them to be true. There's no need to back any of your assertions up or respond to criticisms. Testimony will win the argument as the Spirit confirms the truth."

I didn't know PoR existed until after I played it through. The first time I played Radiant Dawn, I didn't use any guides, didn't know what info was so never saw ANY conversations, didn't know you could talk to people to recruit them until sometime around chapter 3 (missed Aran, Heather... Haar), didn't know there were hidden items you could find with thieves... and it still was my favorite gaming experience of all time. I immediately jumped in to a second playthrough and learned every in and out of every level of that game. I've since played it through 9 times, but never on hard mode (made it to chapter 7 but haven't gone any further.) Seeing as how I've never had anyone to talk to about FE stuff before, I needed to post something on here to kind of squee about :P so I'm curious FE fans: what was your first FE experience?

0,Was expecting tree fiddy...,"Oysters When me and my best friend were 16 we went travelling in Ireland. He's Irish and has family in Ireland who were keeping an eye on us, so we weren't really on our own. Nonetheless it was our first glimpse of independence, even if we were peering at it through the protective arms of his family. Anyway, one night we decided to try and get served at a bar. We went in, my friend walked confidently up to the bar and asked for two pints. The bartender knew we were underage, after all how could anybody not. Nonetheless with a knowing look and a smile he poured us a pint each. About half way through this first pint a group of men walked into the bar and the whole atmosphere changed. It was clear these men were highly respected within this community. We decided to sidle on up to them and start a conversation. They took a liking to us and started buying us drinks. My memory fades rather abruptly at this point, next thing I remember is waking up on a boat. It turns out these men worked on a trawler. We got far to drunk and the men didn't know what to do with us, so they took us out on their boat for the day. Me and my friend tried to make our selves useful, but it was clear we had no idea what we were doing, much to the amusement of the trawler-men. Suddenly a quiet fear settled over the boat. We were heading right for a storm, and the captain, a haggard seaman of many years was scared. Told us later it was the worst storm he'd ever seen. Sure enough a wave came crashing into the side of the boat. We gathered ourselves up and looked around and my friend was nowhere to be seen. He'd been washed overboard by the wave. The captain flew out of his cabin, quickly tying a rope around his waste he dove into the water. There was a moments calm as everyone anxiously waited. A few bubbles floated to the surface. Then we a triumphant splash both captain and friend surfaced. The rest of the crewe dragged them both back on board. Without saying a word, the captain walks over to a pile of oysters and with a flick of his knife opens one up and hands it to the nearest man. It's clear what he is doing, we survived and we are toasting that fact. Since we don't have beer an oyster shall have to suffice. We raised our oysters and downed them in unison and they just weren't for me really..."

In English, he's exactly what I would expect a hundred-year-old monster slayer to sound like: weathered, weary, but with with a little spark for things that he truly cares about and a dry wit regarding his gruesome occupation. In TW3, the writers definitely fit more of his dry humor in and the voice actor nailed it IMO. Some of the more humorous side quest sequences with Geralt were just great."

Most ASOIAF and GOT fanatics out there seem to agree with the theory the Rhaegar and Lyanna form the true parentage of Jon Snow. This must be false for one simple reason. Early on in the books and in the TV series we hear/read about a simple phrase that has a lot of meaning ""The seed is strong"". What does this mean? This is learnt the hard way by Eddard Stark who found out that Jeoffrey was not the true-born son of King Robert Beratheon. The saying "" The seed is strong"" referred to the hair color and physical traits that appear throughout the most powerful families in Westeros. Simple proof of this is shown when Eddard finds out that all Baraetheon born children are ""black of hair""... Back to Jon Snow and how this relates to him. Jon Snow CANNOT be the true-born son of Rhaegar Targaryen because he does not have BLONDE HAIR! It's as simple as that. We know through deduction that Stark children are known to have weak genes because we find Stark characters like Sansa who share Tully features. We also know that The Targaryen blood-line is known to have the strongest genes which appear in every true-born Targaryen child. If Jon Snow really is the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark then Jon Snow SHOULD have Blonde hair. It's as easy as saying Dominant gene + Recessive gene= a baby with the Dominant gene. Please review my theory and tell me what you think"

It's hard to tile properly and the dock is huge and not exactly efficient. Plus it's a pain in the ass to properly maximize windows while retaining the ability to switch applications without using keybinds. Localization is just out of whack. Context menus at the top of the display is probably the worst idea I've ever seen as far as UX goes. On OS X your mouse constantly jumps from the top to the bottom of the screen. Perhaps the most damning thing is that there is no governing logic behind the contextual menus (or really any of the GUI tools). You open them all until you find the option you need that's not one of the big round buttons on the application itself. The desktop on Windows is one of the many things that Microsoft did extremely well and there's a reason many DE's on Linux base themselves on it. The idea of starting from the bottom left and gradually delegate the less important/frequently used UI elements to the top right is the most efficient I've seen. Its only real weakness is multi-display systems.

Tolerance is partly defined as a ""permissive attitude""... essentially, you are putting yourself in a position of power and saying ""I am allowing this to occur."" In the context of a Christian tolerating a member of the LGBT community, you are saying ""We're still right, and you're still wrong, but since we're so gracious, we'll tolerate you and pat you on the back."" It's still stratified, and the person you are tolerating is still beneath you. Acceptance can be defined as an ""approving attitude"". What you are confronting is another human being leading a distinctly different, but equally valuable life from your own. There is nothing to judge or forgive or allow in the choices another human being makes in their life... frankly, what makes them happy is none of your goddamned business. Accepting someone as they are is as simple as saying ""Hey! I'm a person, and you're a person too. How cool is that?"" and moving on. They don't need my permission through my tolerance to live their own life. But their life can be more comfortable if more people can just get over themselves and realize we're all on this space rock together. That was a bit rambling, but I hope it helps."

One of my best friends left the 14th best school in the nation, an incredibly competitive and well respected science school, with a 3.9 in Neuroscience, got hired by said school right after, after publishing two papers with second billing, running both experiments, analyzing data, publishing reports, flying to DC to present, being told he should not look anywhere but the top 5 masters programs in neuro...and our school pays him less than 30k for full time, then cuts his hours to 20 a week, and eventually forces him to leave to look for funding for a masters. It's a joke. Sorry for rambling, I wanted to do research earlier, but the field being what it is in anything non cancer, and my professors' advice to pick a different path has left me salty. It's 90%-100% our gov't. Science research is the first to go.

Coach [Kirk] Ferentz has been doing a great job at Iowa, and I'm looking forward to seeing what he does this year. Notre Dame: ""Notre Dame is like a bigger version of Bishop Moore. It is a private Catholic school with great academic support and awesome people. I'm visiting in the summer and can't wait. Coach [Brian] Kelly is truly a great guy as well as a coach. The tradition at Notre Dame is crazy, and I love it. Playing on NBC every Saturday isn't that bad either."" Oklahoma: ""When you step on campus, you can feel the amazing tradition flowing in the air. Coach [Bob] Stoops is an amazing, genuine guy who will take care of you just right. It's all about winning and family over in Norman. He said I would be the perfect fit, and he doesn't see why I couldn't go in as a freshman and make a big impact at Oklahoma."" Ole Miss: ""When we were driving into Oxford, it shocked my eyes how beautiful the campus was. Coach [Hugh] Freeze is a very, very authentic person. He truly cares about his players and everyone around the program. The people in Oxford are as nice as you can be, and it makes it feel like a family atmosphere."" Penn State: ""It's the most friendly environment I've been in. The people, fans, coaches, players...just everyone is as genuine as you can get. Coach [James] Franklin is going to build Penn State into a top program in the Big Ten, and I truly believe that. He's a guy who will take care of you forever and one of the best head coaches you can ask for. Also, craziest game I've ever seen in my life."""

0,"The schools seemed fine in portland, unless you are talking about the portland public school district, which i hear horror stories About.","I lived in Portland Oregon for over 10 years. Mostly in SE Portland which is imho the best part of town. I worked downtown most of those years. I moved to Vancouver Washington after my wife and I had a baby. Portland is awesome if you're single or a young newlywed. Lots of great brewpubs, great local music scene. Amazing food. Most folks are pretty easy going, at least in SE, North and NE. Downtown clubs and scenester bars are full of drunk douchebags and ""white drunk"" girls. That's true of pretty much any city though. NW is where the downtown crowd goes when they want to be calm and arrogant. SW is fucking boring. The income taxes are fucking bullshit and the rent fucking sucks. So you'll find a great tech job and blow most of it on taxes and rent. Once you have a family you quickly realize what a shit city it is for grownups. The schools are quite literally some of the shittiest in the entire nation. Which is baffling because they have a fuck huge budget. And yet, every year a consortium of hyper liberal bureaucrats will hit the TV begging to raise property taxes (which translates to higher rent) because the schools are broke. Again. A lot of the roads are super shitty too. *** We moved to Vancouver because the rents cheaper for bigger and nicer homes, the crime rate is lower, the schools are some of the best in the nation (with a lower budget too .. strange), and there's no income tax. So once I found a good job in town in Vancouver, it was like an automatic 9% raise. They don't tax your groceries just your .. stuff. So you can still drive across the river for televisions and laptops and clothes and toys. You're not supposed to but everyone does. You'll hear that Vancouver is too rednecky but it's just because we're not annoyingly hyper liberal. It's actually a really progressive city in a really progressive state. We legalized gay marriage and recreational weed before Oregon did, we pay our teachers better, our cops aren't under federal investigation. You'll hear that Vancouver doesn't have as good of restaurants but I've found great Mexican, Thai, Chinese, hamburger and breakfast comfort food that rivals the best in Portland at like 1/3 of the price. What we don't have are lots of strip clubs and lots of cocaine. And we don't have much of a local music scene. *** Weather in both cities is amazing this time of year until almost Halloween. Then it dumps copious amounts of water on Halloween and proceeds to drizzle for the rest of the year. Occasionally it snows a moderate bit of snow and the entire community grinds to a screeching halt. You have to learn to put on a hoody, throw it over your head, and brave the drizzle. It's just a matter of conditioning yourself to leave the house when the weather gets shitty. Because it's really not all that shitty, usually just grey, misty and chilly."

Nick is very spiritual man, who tells me he lives life by personal code honor to always speak his truth mind. And so he admit to me that when he read my message to him felt like a destiny. Nick explain that his lawyers telling him he not allowed to fight for very long time because fighting commission find marijuana. He is feeling lost in life. And he sees my post and BAM he realize he can have fresh start in life in Russia. He even say me that he training sambo since teenager! He speak a few Russian word to me and say me that he really has a true respect for Russian culture, because Russians are not bitches. I return compliment to Nick, saying I admire his fearless. Nick is very giving man, very little asking about money or a material thing. He want to know about our style the life in my small town. How we train, how we spend time.

They knew what hotel you were at very quickly after you returned. So either they're monitoring you directly or indirectly, either way that's deeply troubling. Did you ever figure out whether there's something on your car or phones? 2. They're not respecting the TPO. 3. Your dogs were definitely poisoned. Especially if they died at the same time, that's a huge and terrifying red flag. Please contact whatever state agency you need to in order to get the proper autopsy that can be used in court. Consult your lawyer if necessary. You need to keep any letters or other things they give to you as evidence. You don't have to read them, but give them to your lawyer. They may admit guilt or other things but you definitely don't want to be accused of destroying evidence. You and your husband need to treat every encounter with these people as potentially life-threatening. If you see them, go to the nearest group of people and call the cops. Do not engage them, do not give them any ammunition or ability to claim that they were defending themselves, or the satisfaction. Your husband really hurt your case, here. I personally think that your husband is being an idiot. Unless there's some kind of complicated custody issue at play, he needs to realize that his other child is safe with his ex for now and his current wife and new children are literally under threat for their life. Forcing you to stay around because he wants to see his other child is selfish and demonstrates a lack of basic concern for your well being.

My boss made some polite comment and she went on to say that she thinks I grew up quickly when my girlfriend got pregnant when I was 15. She also said something like 'it's crazy to think only two years ago you were getting arrested for bar fights and now you're working at a company like this!' The back story on that is that I punched a man who was physically attacking a woman on the ground. I was temporarily handcuffed until the cops saw the security footage. Never even saw the back of a cop car. But of course she didn't tell them that I was trying to protect someone, she just told them I was arrested for getting into bar fights two years ago and laughed it off. My bosses were horrified. One of them texted me under the table and told me to excuse myself for a family emergency before this woman comes back with another story and our clients run for the hills. I later explained the situation to them, but that doesn't fix the fact that I was trying to sell a million-dollar deal to clients and Karen was bringing up things that would make them not want to put their trust in me. I called Karen that night and told her that while it was nice to see her, intimate stories about my past can be a little uncomfortable for clients. I asked her to keep them in the family in the future. She became incredibly upset. She seems to feel that this is not actually about the stories, but that she thinks I'm embarrassed that I knew someone who is a waitress for a living. She believes that I'm asking her not to tell stories so it will look like we don't even know one another. She ended a long rant by saying that next time she sees me at a business lunch, she'll only have one embarrassing story to tell - the one of how I'm an entitled prick and I'm ashamed of the very people who helped raise me. Now I have two concerns. 1. Should I try talking to her again? Or just let this settle down? 2. I don't THINK she'd actually try to ""get revenge"" or whatever by bringing this up if she's our waitress at future lunches...but I don't know. A friend has suggested that I let the manager know we'd prefer a different waitress for future lunches and I'm seriously considering it. --- **tl;dr**: Mom's friend embarrassed me in front of clients during a business lunch. I asked her to not tell stories about me to my boss/clients and she's upset with me, and vaguely threatened to make the next lunch difficult as well."

I think this tragedy will stick with people for a while, for good reason. You're seriously a horrible person if you choose this particular moment to defend the flag associated with terrorist groups. I also think the protests in Ferguson/Baltimore play into this.

He clearly outlines why an attack against NATO wouldn't make any sense, and he does do a pretty decent job of highlighting the U.S.'s aggressive maneuvers against Russia (though he does neglect to mention his aggressive air force drills against the U.S. and U.K.) What Russia is doing in Ukraine right now is no different than what the U.S. did in Central and South America during the 1960's-1980's. They're preventing rival forces from gaining power in their perceived ""sphere of influence"". The U.S. didn't want pro-USSR, communist forces gaining footholds in nations such as Cuba and Nicaragua. Likewise, Russia doesn't want pro-Western forces gaining footholds in Eastern Europe and the Baltic States. I don't support Russia's aggressive intervention in Ukraine, but there's nothing unusual or unprecedented about it. When a global power's sphere of influence is threatened, they always take actions to root out the threat. The U.S. funded and armed the Contras and the anti-Castro forces, and Russia is funding and arming the pro-Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine. It's nothing new, and it doesn't indicate that Russia is gearing up for a full scale war against Europe, despite what some media outlets and Reddit commenters would have you believe."

0,Also people with harpoon A can cut the 100 metre rope by modding it,"A strange analogy about PC vs Console spawned from a skype discussion. I was having a skype conversation with a friend. He wasn't quite getting my pains I felt over the current gaming industry. The opinion I have here is mine, if you disagree, feel free to state your own, I'm open to interpretations. My friend wants to buy a harpoon gun, so I made this strange analogy to bring the point across. ~You are buying a harpoon gun. Two options. ~Both do the same thing. Shoot harpoons. One can shoot them 500 meters (and takes a small amount of setup, very easy). ~The other can only shoot them 100m and requires no setup, but the marketing team (and users) of the 100m harpoon is telling you to buy it because harpoons aren't meant for shooting things far away, and that the harpoon is stronger and a better buy because it shoots closer and therefore means you will always hit what you want to. ~That's harpoon B. ~Harpoon A: 1. Shoots further Shoots a harder hitting projectile (if it's good at 500m, imagine how killer at 100m) 3. can also be swapped out with several harpoons to match your harpoon tastes and preferences 4. can easily be fixed without causing too many issues. 5. costs the same amount as harpoon B. ~Which one are you likely to buy now? ""well harpoon A is clearly better no doubt"" ~Now, you've bought harpoon A, yep? ""yes"" ~Unfortunately, for those not as versed in harpooning as you several bought harpoon B. ~And now the harpoon industry only manufactures harpoons that have rope that can uncoil to 100m. ~So you can't even use the extent of your better harpoon. they also start manufacturing less diverse harpoons. because it's easier. Now, don't you feel stupid buying harpoon A? ~But wait. Now tons of people are telling you you're a dumbass for buying harpoon A. and the marketing team for harpoon B is using your lack of diversity and range (caused by them!) to further market harpoon B. The human brain cannot contemplate harpooning things further than 100m away! ~Now to top it off... ~Harpoon B has an exclusive shit-tipped harpoon, for extreme harpooning!

Just as GNU doesn't have a usable kernel, Linux doesn't have a usable anything else.

As such, the teaser animatronic is either Springtrap (in some new form) OR another serial killer in a ""springtrap-like"" suit (enter multiple purple guy theories).

The Saudis likely don't give a shit about that, but find it an easy excuse to drop their own prices."

0,Grow up and eat your vegetables,"New to slow-cooking. Very picky eater (hate 95% of veggies, really wish I didn't). Would appreciate recipes that are easy to make and possibly budget-friendly. First of all, sorry for all the demands! Here's my problem. I ***hate*** cooking. I really can't stand it and so I've been known to eat very badly (i.e. fast food, frozen dinners, etc). I would really like to break this habit of treating my body so poorly with such bad food. I got a crockpot so I could lessen that loathing I have for cooking, and so I could make healthier meals, as well as save money by making multiple meals from one batch. I've looked through some recipes on here but I'm hoping there's some kind folks in this sub who might humor me and share some recipes and/or tips that subscribe to my picky eating habits and get me away from bad sugary processed foods. I am not a fan of vegetables. **HATE** * Broccoli, cauliflower, asaparagus, cabbage, squash, brussel sprouts, eggplant, cucumber, leeks, mushrooms, peas, squash, turnips, zuchinni, spinach, green/bell peppers **LIKE** * Corn, carrots, garlic, artichoke (I do not like pickled artichoke hearts though), green beans, and onions. Onions are weird for me, I like the sweet maui onions, but I always preferred to peel them in cloves and saute them in a little butter on the grill with a steak. I'm not a fan of the raw texture when they're sliced. I like a lot of fruits. bananas, apples, oranges, I absolutely love avocadoes, grapes, cantaloupe, pineapple, strawberries, pears. I hate peaches. Can you make rice dishes in a crockpot? For me that would be amazing. Rice and chicken breast with some random veggies thrown in. I really know nothing and when I'm not in such a hurry I'm going to really sit down and read through a lot of slow-cooking recipes/material. If anyone has some simple &lt;6 ingredient slow-cook recipes, it would mean a lot to me if you could share them. I've lost a lot of weight through exercise and I'm not afraid of some calories. A few recipes with rice or potatoes and some type of meat (chicken, pork, beef, fish) would be amazing. Or if rice is not an option a stew would be great too, anything I can take to work in a tupperware. Vegetables are a lot easier for me to eat if they're in a stew. For example I hate peas but in some dishes I can't even taste them so they don't bother me at all. But I think that destroys all the nutritional content they offer, doesn't it? I'll stop rambling. Thank you to anyone who reads this or takes the time to respond, and have a nice day. =D"

When the characters go into a dream within a dream, the concept is called recursion, and not inception. **TL;DR: Eh-cursion, not eh-ception**"

0,Classic Dad.,"TIFU by giving my boyfriend a blow job So this didn't happen today but back in high school. My cheeks still get red every time I think about this. My boyfriend my senior year of high school lived in the same neighborhood as I did, so we saw each other fairly often. He was hanging out at my house after school one day, and my parents decided to leave to go pick us up some food for dinner. We had been dating more than a year at this point, so they were okay with leaving us alone. Well the second they left, we got down to business and the blow job train was a'rollin. Since we were both really into it, we didn't hear the garage door go up or the downstairs door open. Next thing I know I hear my dad calling my name coming up the stairs. My boyfriend's pants are down. I've got slobber all around my mouth. Apparently my dad had been calling me on my cell this whole time asking about a clarification on what we wanted to eat, so he had a pretty good idea what was up. My bf puts a pillow over his crotch and I wipe the side of my face and sprint to the door. I open it right as he's standing outside of it. ""Hey Dad, what's up?"" ""Hey v_jax, I brought y'all the food you wanted from Moe's, but it seems as if you've already eaten."" Cue silent walkaway. I hang my head in shame. Boyfriend leaves.

I had just locked my doors to our beer coolers, and started going back to cleaning the store. I had some officers out front dealing with a person slumped over in his car. I wasn't to worried as I am pretty friendly with the officers in my city. I also work right next to a bar. Like you can throw a rock and hit it close. This guy comes in and makes a bee line towards our beer cooler and attempts the open the dark beer doors. He starts to get irritated and the following ensues: (MC for the customer that came in, FC for the lady he was with Me for me) MC: Its not even 2 yet, why can't you sell me beer? Me: Corporate policy dictates that I have to have my beer doors locked at 1:55. This is whats required, and told to me by my manager. There is nothing I can do MC: *insert stomping out and yelling ""HORSESHIT!"", when he was almost to the door, he sees the officers outside* You are supposed to sell beer until 2 am, it is state law. Me: I know it is state law. We have been having a lot of stolen beer, especially as we get closer to 2. As soon as it hits 2 am and I stop beer, I have cases walking out the door. My manager wants it locked earlier, and I will lock it earlier, its out of my hands MC: Its illegal to deny the sale of alcohol, I am going to get the officers out front and they are going to force you to sell me alcohol Me: By all means go for it, I am not opening those beer doors MC: *Knowing it didn't phase me or frighten me to open the doors, he escalates by raising his voice. By this time FC comes in and asks whats going on. After hearing about whats going on, she approaches me* FC: Why can't you sell beer? Me: We have been having a lot of beer runs closer to 2 that we get, my boss wants me to have it locked at 1:55 FC looks a little upset and MC is getting more and more upset and started yelling. At which point I calmly asked MC to leave. He promptly leaves, as does FC. I go back to my cleaning."

0,Set your phone to vibrate with priority notifications only (Alarms are priority notifications).,"My Galaxy S5 running Lollipop is waking me up every night vibrating. What can I do? So, I upgraded to Lollipop a few days ago, and now during the night while my phone is charging, it periodically vibrates and turns on the screen every time the phone is fully charged. It does this multiple times during the night as it stops charging, then after the phone loses some charge, it starts charging again, gets charged fully, and vibrates again. I tend to get awoken easily, and last night the damn phone woke me from a sound sleep with a stupid vibration and it took me a couple of hours to get back to sleep just in time to get awoken again by the next vibration. With KitKat, I had Tasker automatically silence my phone when I put it on charge during a set period of hours, and that worked great. Now with Lollipop, the ""on"" option is missing from the ""Silent"" setting in Tasker because Google apparently decided to remove the capability from the OS for who knows what reason. So, it seems the choices that I get with Lollipop are as follows: 1. Don't charge my phone, so my phone will probably be dead by morning and my alarm won't go off because my phone is dead. 2. Turn the phone to ""Mute"" mode before I go to bed, but darn, that mutes the alarm, too, so that's pretty pointless. 3. Charge my phone, but don't bother sleeping. Sleeping is over-rated anyway. How can there not be an option to charge your phone and not get awoken all through the night by a stupid vibration and screen turning on? Am I missing something here? At this point it looks like my phone can no longer be used as an alarm clock and I'll have to go to the old fashioned alarm clock and charge my phone in the other room. If anyone knows of a way to charge my phone at night and not have it vibrate and turn on the screen, please let me know. Thanks."

I live 6 hours away, and getting time off is not too easy. I've been planning this for awhile, and don't want to hold up plans for this guy. Furthermore, this party is being planned for my brother, not for this dude. I am going to speak to him tomorrow, and I'm basically going to tell him that the event is going to be happening regardless, and I'm really sorry if he can't make it. I'm sure he is going to throw out the ""kid"" card on me, so I can't wait to tell him I'm not going to change plans because of this need. It's his responsibility, not mine.

Hilarious spoopypasta","Fanfic Saturday (Friday): Sammy goes buys an EvilStick **Ninja edit** ""goes"" shouldn't be in the title but I'll just leave it because I can't change it. It was the Friday before Black Friday and Sammy decided to get some Christmas shopping out of the way. He decided to go to his local dollar store because he didn't feel like shopping for quality merchandise this year. The toy aisle was like one in any other dollar store. There were Barbies on one side and baby dolls on the other side. There were also cheap knockoffs of Lego and Gi. Joe and inflatable hammers and swords depicting Marvel characters for some reason. Sammy was calmly perusing this large selection when one toy in particular caught his eye. It was a pink plastic wand. The package depicted some anime girls and it said ""Evil Stick"" on it in cursive. ""This will be perfect for Hailey!"" Sammy exclaimed. Thirty minutes later he took his armful of quality merchandise to the checkout counter and left. The entire walk home Sammy felt... uneasy. He felt as if someone or... something... was watching him. He turned around several times but saw nothing out of the ordinary. Sammy started walking faster toward his house. Sammy slammed the door behind him and ran upstairs. He dashed into his room, threw the armful of stuff on the floor and locked the door behind him. The feeling of uneasiness was stronger than it was before. He decided that playing some video games would eaaaaase his tensions a bit. He turned on his Wii U and played a few rounds of Smash. When he was about to start his fifth round, something strange happened. The screen started flickering. He thought this was nothing, but it got weirder. He selected the ""random"" option when choosing his stage and it selected ""Dark Woods"" which he had never seen before. When the stage loaded, the cpu player was a demonic girl with a large knife. Sammy shrieked as the girl ran over to Sonic (who he was playing as) and started stabbing him to death. Sonic was defeated in seconds and it cut to the victory screen. The screen was flickering a lot now. The girl's face suddenly appeared on the screen and covered most of it. She had a evil grin that would make the Grinch jelly and it said ""You died"" in large, bloody letters. Sammy shrieked again and shut off the game. He shuffled through the things he just bought until he grabbed the evil stick. He noticed that the foil on the stick could be pulled away. He did so and he saw a picture of the girl. Suddenly, he heard a Satanic laughter all around him. Sammy shrieked a third time and dashed out of his room. He suddenly realized that both of his parents were at work, his sister was shopping with some friends, and his younger brother was at a friend's house. He was... alone. He whipped his phone and dialed his mom's number. ""*Please pick up, please pick up....*"" Sammy chanted. His mom wasn't the person who answered the phone. ""**YOU CANNOT ESCAPE**"" The voice yelled. The Satanic laughing continued on the other end of the phone. Sammy to his phone and he threw it on the ground (I ain't a part of your system). He dashed out of his house. Since it was winter the days were getting shorter and it was already dark. Sammy didn't even think where he was going and ran until he reached the woods in a park that was near his house. He was already deep in the woods when he realized what a dire mistake he had made. Sammy stopped to catch his breath. He heard a rustling in the woods and whipped around. There was nothing but he heard the voice again. ""**SONIC CANNOT SAVE YOU NOW**"" A dark presence floated toward him. Sammy blacked out. He woke up in his room on the floor. It was still dark out, but it was a few hours after he ran into the woods. He couldn't remember anything after that. Suddenly, his mom called his name. ""Sammy, time for dinner! Hurry, everyone's waiting for you!"" He sighed a sigh of relief and went downstairs, but he noticed that the Evil Stick was gone. He thought that maybe buying it was all just a dream and he would sort everything out later. What he would soon realize was that Smash had a new item that wasn't in any other copy of the game. The end &lt;3"

0,"The question is, do we let the children of incapable parents suffer in the effort to avoid letting irresponsible parents getting away with it?","I hate to say it, but I see a lot of irresponsible parenting result in child poverty. And then I see a lot of young parents and solo mothers doing very well, even on the benefit. What's going on here? I may get downvoted for this but it's an honest observation, and one I believe needs to be addressed if you actually want to target and remove child poverty. A lot of these young parents or solo parents need to grow up and stop spending what little money they have on alcohol/drugs and tobacco. I'm 24 years old so I've seen atleast 20 of my friends get pregnant and have children and I hate to say it, but a high percentage of them ARE IRRESPONSIBLE. That's just the way it is. But one of my friends, she's a solo mother in Auckland, on the benefit. Doesn't drink, doesn't smoke, doesn't do any drugs and yet she rents a place in Auckland and they live quite comfortably. I commend her everytime I see her, because she reminds me of my own mother, who like her, raised me and my 2 brothers solo, never spending any money on said luxuries. Not saying this is applicable to all cases, but I'd say a large dose of them, and it's something people have to realise, we can't shy away or act overly PC when we're dealing with children that can't help the situation they're in."

I've kinda screwed it up a bit So, I graduated in May, and now I'm here, at home, and I haven't properly applied to a college, and only just took the ACT on the 8th. I went through high school with poor grades, and I failed a few(like five) classes and my cumulative GPA was like, 2.5. I really messed up, I know, but I'm not dumb, I swear. Honestly, I'm considered one of the smartest kids in my school, and that combined with my laziness is what spelled my doom. I got bad grades because nothing was a challenge, everything was way too easy, so I didn't want to do it. I love learning, but my classes taught me little, and I don't like redundancy. I'm a good kid, though. I only got like five minor write-ups for sleeping and getting on my phone. My peers will tell you I'm smart and kind. I was never rude and never intrusive. Maybe even to the point where it was a bad thing. I ghosted through high school, though and made little friends and didn't get involved in any extracurricular activities. Anyway, back to my main point. I'm at home, with no awards, poor grades, no outgoing applications, and no idea what the f to do. I'm probably screwed, but if I'm not: Please, help me. I'm really scared that I'm doomed to live on this reservation forever. Did I mention I am a Native American who comes from one of the poorest counties in America with a per capita income of $7,714? 5th lowest btw. Luckily, my mom and step-mom, (yes, they're in a homosexual partnership) are working hard to raise me and my two brothers. I've known poverty, and I've known hunger. Everyone here has, and I'm scared. I don't want to be here forever. I want to see the world. I still have dreams. I just need guidance. So please, if you can, help me. Any and all advice is welcome. Also, I understand my past laziness must go, and I've been struggling with that coupled with depression. The depression is from previous mental abuse(not from my moms, no.) that just stuck around. I still find it hard to look at myself in the mirror without crying. I often feel worthless and like I'll amount to nothing, but that's something I have been dealing with. The thing I'm lost on is college. Where do I go? Who do I talk to? What can I do? Sorry if this was too long, but I'm desperate. Again, any advice is welcome. So, please, tell me what you can. I'll respond to everything, so conversations are welcome. Sorry for the lack of proper paragraphs."

Talked to lawyer, either i can buy plan for him ""somewhere"" and maybe get state to accept that, or go on company plan. Child support rep is, well a man-hater and is no help. HR at work's hands are tied due to paperwork sent from state. will be talking to the obama-care hotline, see if i can qualify for and subsidy, but not hopeful. Desperate, about to be homeless, penniless, and hungry. yes i have thought about the car. even if i sold it for a good price, id still be out $2k, and needing a way to get to work. cant realyl defer the loans much longer. paying just a little over on cc, that will ease up... in 6+ months .."

0,Somewhat ironic that odds are it was Home Depot and the like that put the mom and pop out of business in the first place.,"Dwindling options at big box home improvement stores I'm noticing an alarming trend at the big box hardware stores -- dwindling stock options. Today, I needed some wire (single strand, RW-90, 14 ga.), so I stopped at Home Depot (the other big store in town, Rona, doesn't stock any RW-90 at all). For some reason they only stocked red and green insulated wire, and the guy cutting it for me let me know that once those rolls were empty they wouldn't be bringing in any more. Apparently they're getting out of the cut-to-length business. I've also noticed that their pipe fitting selection is rapidly shrinking, they don't stock anything over 1"" NPT. The electrical selection has become crap too. It seems like they're eliminating any SKU that doesn't sell well, and their stock ends up quite disjointed because of it (things like stocking street elbows in 1/2"" and 3/4"" sizes, but not 1"", but they stock all of the other standard 1"" fittings), I get that from a strictly economical point of view, it doesn't make sense to stock an item that only sells 4 or 5 units per year, but they're turning themselves into Wal-Mart. What is even more frustrating is that I ""lost"" my local mom'n'pop hardware store this year; they just couldn't afford to stay in business anymore. And they stocked everything in 1/20th of the space. I know I can order things online, but when I find out I need something on Friday so that I can get rolling on a project on Saturday, that doesn't work for me. One last complaint: the tool selection at the stores is pure garbage. Ever try to find a non-garbage drill bit at a big box store? How about a metric tap? Or even a tap at all? Hack saw blades? They have one size in stock, and it's a junk one at that. If I had other options, I wouldn't be so frustrated if I could find a piece of wire, a single pipe fitting, or a number size drill in a city with 4 big hardware stores and two tool stores. Are any of y'all noticing similar trends?"

0,You're still cool bud!,"At the young and tender age of 23, I took a road trip with my sociopathic friend and drug dealer to buy some weed. The little town I lived in at the time was almost completely dry, and I figured I could buy few ounces and be the hero of the town for a week or two. I had been sober for about a month and ready to break that record in a big way, so I bought 3 40oz to drink on the way (it was a 2 hour drive.) I don't condone drinking and driving so I let my friend take the wheel while I finished all three. All the way down there, my friend was talking about robbing someone to make his rent in that half-joking way that he always did and I laughed it off; selling drugs is way more profitable anyway. He agreed. He's just the kind of guy that liked violence. When we arrived at the first stop I stumbled out of the car and drunkenly bought what I came to get. As soon as we got back in the car we promptly smoked to the point where the edges of my vision started to go white. He tells me we have one more stop to make. He brought some meth with him that he needed to sell. Shit. Well, in for a penny, in for a pound. We show up to a house that screamed ""meth house"" at the top of its lungs. One window had been replaced by a garbage bag, the paint was peeling, the ""lawn"" was weeds interspersed with irregular patches of dirt and a single stripped pick-up truck that smelled like raccoons had been using it as an orgy den for years. I started to get worried. My friend, Kyle, says ""don't worry, just try not to look like a cop, and take this in case shit gets crazy."" He hands me a knife. I would like to point out at this time that I am not a fighter. I'm a short-by-midwestern-standards, pale, suburban, pretty-boy, straight-A, pacifist stoner. This is not my element. Kyle makes his deals while I sit down and talk to the meth-heads. I don't remember much. I was insanely twisted already. A pretty girl passes me a pipe. I don't understand how it works, but I don't wanna be rude. I try to take a small hit. People yell. I'm doing it wrong. Pretty girl smiles at me and lights it for me and tells me how to smoke it. It's not as harsh as I would've thought and tastes like nothing so much as bland chemicals. It feels...amazing. I hardly feel the alcohol and the weed as I take a another hit each time its passed. I wonder vaguely who's paying for this as people add more crystals which I smoke greedily. Eventually pretty girl and I go to a very large closet to fool around. I'm horny--hornier than I've ever been in my life, but I cannot for the life of me get an erection. Not just that, the thing looked like it had shrunk, retreating into my body more than I thought possible. I start to freak out. She tells me not to freak out. I freak out anyway. I find Kyle. He's smoking meth with his own group. I ask him if meth is killing my dick and he laughs. ""Sometimes that happens, you just need to relax. Here."" He gives me 4 little pills. Xanax. He says take 1 or 2 now and save some for when the meth wears off. Directions unclear--I take 4. I go to find pretty girl, but she is now having sex with near-toothless dude. Damn. Me and Kyle leave. We drive for an hour in manic conversation. Both of us talking, neither of us listening. Kyle wants to do a home invasion. ""Maybe we can rob a liquor store. Does that sound fun?"" He asks. Everything sounds fun on meth, but I pass anyway. I'll wait in the car. I feel foggy. Maybe the xanax or the alcohol? I figure meth will clear away that fog. Kyle goes to rob someone while I stay in the car finishing off the meth. Holy shit, he's back. ""how'd it go?"" ""They were closed and wouldn't let me in. Quick, that Subway has the back door propped open. Drive!"" I drive. They're taking trash out the back. Two girls. ""We have to be quick, come on."" (We?) He hands me a baseball bat and takes a machete from somewhere in the back. (Have we been driving with those the whole time?) I can't think at this point so I follow orders. I'm good at that. We are waiting outside the propped open door and Kyle looks at me and says ""Now as soon as you see the girl, you run up and pop the bitch on the back of the head with the bat, and I'll run in and take care of the other one."" My mind gives me one small burst of thought ""I can't do that."" ""Why the fuck not?"" He looks disgusted. What do I say? (She'sagirl.Idon'tlikeviolence.Thisiscrazy.I'mnotthisperson) ""Look there's 2 girls and no car in the parking lot. At least one of them is probably waiting on a ride from a boyfriend or husband or something."" He considers that. (That was clever) A girl walks out the back door. Kyle twitches. I grab his arm. ""I have a better idea."" I say. ""I used to night audit at a hotel. There's probably just one guy sitting at a desk alone, bored and probably stoned. We could walk in and rob him and nobody has to (get hurt) take any risk."" He agrees. We find a hotel. I'm nervous He pulls out one more crystal of meth. We smoke it. Still nervous. We smoke some weed. Still nervous, but also excited--Feeling alive. This could be fun. This time I take the machete. I don't like the idea of Kyle having it, besides we won't need to use it. Two people with weapons against one guy without. He won't fight us. He'll be scared (I'm scared). There's a back room behind the office with the guy. Kyle goes in the back. I go to the front to distract him and get the phone so no one calls the cops. Wtf do I do with the machete? It won't fit in my pants. I drop it outside. I won't need it. No one's going to get hurt anyway. I go in and talk about room prices. I say I need to use to phone to call my wife (lie). I pretend to use the phone. CRASH. Kyle broke in the back. There is a second man. Oh Shit. They are fighting over the bat, rolling on the floor. First man screams ""CALL THE COPS!"" (ohshitohshitohshit) I stand there until Kyle calls my name. Now everyone is looking at me. I still have the phone. I hand the phone to the first man and say ""here, call the cops."" (I am not a very good robber). I join the struggle and take hold of the bat. I get the bat away from both of them and now I have the bat. Everyone is looking at me again. I drop the bat and tell Kyle to run. He runs. I follow. He is bleeding; he runs into a cornfield. He has the keys to the car (wtf?) So I run too. Cops show up, but I get away. There are cops all over town, patrolling and looking for me. One sees me, I run, backtrack, and evade him. I try to sleep under a car in a junkyard. Cops with dogs enter junkyard. I run again. I hear barking and ""STOP."" I run anyway. I crawl through a small ditch to get across the road. Find Walmart. I buy new clothes. Wash myself in bathroom. Change behind dumpster. I see cop in store as I'm leaving. I walk (becalmbecalmbecalm) away as cop leaves store. He gets in his car and follows me. I see a girl smoking outside a hotel. Nothing suspicious about 2 people smoking outside a hotel, right? I hit her up for a light. We smoke as cop drives past slowly looking directly at us. She flirts with me. (isshefuckingcrazy?) I flirt too. I ask ""What's with all these cops in a small town like this."" ""Ohmigod! They came and talked to me earlier. These 2 guys robbed a hotel down the road with baseball bats"" ""Holy shit, that's scary."" ""I know...I'm actually really glad you're here."" I try not to laugh (or cry). I rent a room. Can't sleep. Realize my phone was in the car, and the car is still at the hotel. Realize I'm going to prison. In the morning I feel like my soul has been beaten and stabbed. My mind hurts, my spirit hurts, my legs hurt. I buy some sushi and turn myself into the police. Kyle got away and fled the state. I got 4 years probation. That was 2 years ago, and the entire experience is the most surreal and terrifying thing that I have ever been involved in. TL;DR: Alcohol, weed, meth, xanax, and a failed armed robbery"

So we picked ""Babylonian."" Anytime you might say something like ""that's gay"" you instead had to say ""that's Babylonian.""

Everybody was contained to their classrooms whilst this happened, but due to phones, pictures made their way around very quickly. Why did he need to be airlifted, you may ask?

He hit his head on somebody's knee and got a little dizzy. 15 minutes later on the way to class, he blacked out. He lost 6 months of memory temporarily, and was otherwise completely fine, but we continue to tease him about the whole thing - the 'swinging him around' thing was completely consensual!
